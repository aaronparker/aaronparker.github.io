Back in 2016, I [purchased an Intel NUC](https://stealthpuppy.com/intel-nuc6i5syb-home-lab/) for running various workloads - it's previously run VMs on Hyper-V (Windows 10) or Ubuntu. For the past few years it has been running a UniFi Network Server, [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#getting-started) and [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io). At over eight years only now, it's past its prime and I've been looking at a replacement for some time.
