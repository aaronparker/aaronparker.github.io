We've been busy planning our next CUGC meet-up for 2017, which will be on the 24th of October at the Telstra Conference Center at 242 Exhibition St. To attend the meet-up, ensure you've signed up at the MyCUGC.org site: [Melbourne Citrix User Group Local Meeting](https://www.mycugc.org/page/melbourne-oct24-2017Meeting) 

# Agenda

We've got Christian Lloyd from Citrix to take us through the XenDesktop / XenApp 7.15 LTSR release. This release is not to be underestimated and I'm expecting to see many organisations finally moving off XenApp 6.5 and those still on 7.6 LTSR, upgrade to 7.15 to take advantage of the new features. Because the latest release has so many features, the theme for this meeting will be '_Doing more with what you have_'; so we'll also take you through some of the really interesting features (e.g. [FAS](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/secure/federated-authentication-service/fas-architectures.html), App Layering, [Workspace Environment Management](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/workspace-environment-management/current-release.html), etc.) that you can be taking advantage of to improve your XD/XA environments. Plus get your questions about how to migrate answered.

## CUGC Community Presentation

We still have space for a community presentation - if you're interested in presenting on any topic related to Citrix technologies, we would love for you to present. 

# Sponsor

This month, we're really happy to have [eG Innovations](https://www.eginnovations.com/) sponsoring our meet-up and to discuss proactive monitoring, assessment and management of your Citrix XenDesktop and XenApp environments. To get an idea what eG Innovations is doing, check out this recent Citrix blog article: [Monitor Logon Performance Seamlessly with eG Innovations](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/09/26/monitor-logon-performance-seamlessly-with-eg-innovations/). Did you know they have a logon simulator? Check it out:

eG Innovations enables us to rent the venue and also provide beer and pizza for XenBeers afterwards, so we'd love to see you there. Even better, they'll be giving away a [Google Home](https://madeby.google.com/home/)!
