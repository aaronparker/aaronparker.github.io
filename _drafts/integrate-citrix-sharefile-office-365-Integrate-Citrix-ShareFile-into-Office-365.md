While Office 365 overall is a great concept, the user experience of OneDrive for Business and SharePoint is less than ideal. Integrating an alternative enterprise file and sync solution can be difficult to justify from a cost perspective - if Office 365 has a storage solution, what benefits do you gain by adding an alternative?

Perhaps a subjective view, but integrating Citrix ShareFile into Office 365 provides a better end-user experience than OneDrive for Business and SharePoint. Plus it works in virtual desktop environments (something you don't get without [3rd party solutions](https://www.fslogix.com)) and enables access to on-premises storage. Thus, an organisation may see value in going Office 365 **and** Citrix ShareFile, or perhaps may already be a ShareFile customer and is moving to Office 365.

To integrate Citrix ShareFile into Office 365, there are a number of touch points worth spending time on to get the user experience just right.

# Single Sign-On

Enabling single sign-on into ShareFile is an important first step for both security and end-user experience. An identity managed across Azure AD (or another identity source) and ShareFile, improves manageability when onboarding and off-boarding users and improves security because end-users need a single identity across Office 365 and ShareFile.
