No, I haven't written a step by step guide, but Microsoft has and they have released a document detailing 802.1X NAP enforcement for demonstration purposes. This is a very detailed resource that will require some time and effort to setup, but if you are interested in NAP and 801.2X then this document is for you. Here's a view of the test lab configuration to give you an idea of what's involved:

> Network Access Protection (NAP) is a new policy enforcement technology in the Windows Vista„¢ and Windows Server® Code Name "Longhorn" operating systems. NAP provides components and an application programming interface (API) set that help administrators enforce compliance with health requirements for network access and communication. This paper contains an introduction to NAP and instructions on how to set up a test lab to deploy NAP with the 802.1X enforcement method. The lab requires two server and two client computers, and an 802.1X compliant switch that supports the use of RADIUS tunnel attributes to specify the 802.1X client VLAN. With this test network, you can create and enforce client health requirements using NAP and the 802.1X features on your switch.
