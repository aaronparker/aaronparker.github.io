I think that the [attachment preview feature (see number 10)](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/office/preview/programs/outlook/top10.mspx) of Outlook 2007 is one of its best new features, however I&#8217;ve noticed that Outlook can&#8217;t preview calendar appointments sent as an attachment. So essentially, Outlook can&#8217;t preview it&#8217;s own files, do&#8217;h! Check out the screenshot:
