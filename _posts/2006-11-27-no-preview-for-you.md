I think that the [attachment preview feature (see number 10)](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/office/preview/programs/outlook/top10.mspx) of Outlook 2007 is one of its best new features, however I've noticed that Outlook can't preview calendar appointments sent as an attachment. So essentially, Outlook can't preview it's own files, do'h! Check out the screenshot:
