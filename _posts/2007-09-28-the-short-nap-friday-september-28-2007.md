The Short NAP is a (semi-regular) quick list of Microsoft Network Access Protection and Server/Domain Isolation related links from around the web. Here are the links for Friday the 28th of September 2007:

  * [StillSecure Introduces Free Network Access Control Solution](http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/070924/0306050.html): StillSecure releases a free version of Safe Access which will help you view and report on your compliance status. This is pretty cool stuff and it comes as a pre-configured VMware appliance. Check out the [Safe Access Lite](http://salite.stillsecure.com/) site for more info.
  * [Serious About NAC](http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=133522): A great article on the realities and expectations of NAC products.
  * [Kaspersky Lab announces support for Microsoft NAP](http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575561): Kaspersky&#8217;s on board with an agent and validator (which installs on the NAP server).
  * [Greetings from the Future (Or, At Least GMT+8)](http://blogs.technet.com/ianhamer/archive/2007/09/14/greetings-from-the-future-or-at-least-gmt-8.aspx): Ian Hameroff talks about his IPsec and NAP talks at TechEd 2007 SEA

  * [TechNet Updates October: Network Policy Server, NAP and WSUS 3.0](http://blogs.technet.com/itproaustralia/archive/2007/09/24/technet-updates-october-network-policy-server-nap-and-wsus-3-0.aspx): If you&#8217;re in Australia and have got some free time in October, why not check out the TechNet Updates sessions on NAP?

And finally:

  * [Windows Server 2008 RC0 Released!](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2007/09/24/windows-server-2008-rc0-released.aspx): You knew this already so stop reading this post and start deploying NAP.
