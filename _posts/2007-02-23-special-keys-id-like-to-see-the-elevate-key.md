Here&#8217;s a key I&#8217;d like to see on new keyboards for Windows Vista - the Elevate Key. I&#8217;ve don&#8217;t know how it would work exactly - you would still be prompted for credentials and perhaps it could elevate the currently selected shortcut or the application in focus (can you elevate an already running process?), but this would certaintly make life with UAC a little simpler:
