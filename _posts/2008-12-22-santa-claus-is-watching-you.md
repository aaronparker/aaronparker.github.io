It’s been a busy December, so it’s been a bit quiet around here and by the time you read this I’ll be on the slopes somewhere around [Arinsal](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Arinsal,+Massana,+Andorra&sll=51.509993,-0.135116&sspn=0.009095,0.019526&g=Arinsal,+Massana,+Andorra&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr), so here’s my final post for the year. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Saturnalia or Yule or whatever it is you do or don’t celebrate at this time of year.

I’m going to leave you with [this little gem from Garfield minus Garfield](http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/post/65761782), it made me chuckle…
