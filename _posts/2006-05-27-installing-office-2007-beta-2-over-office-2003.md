If you currently have Office 2003 (or any Office 2003 component such as Visio or Publisher) installed you&#8217;ll run into some problems if you upgrade to Office 2007 Beta 2*. The Office 2003 components will not be completely removed and you may have issues such as returning shortcuts or Outlook add-ins trying to reinstall eventually bringing Office 2007 to a grinding halt. If this happens, check out the &#8220;Windows Installer CleanUp Utility&#8221; for removing all vestiges of Office 2003. You may then have to perform a repair of the Office 2007 applications. See [KB290301](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=290301) for more information. Probalby best to remove an ealier version of Office before installing Office 2007.

(* It&#8217;s probably mentioned in the release notes somewhere but why waste time reading release notes when you want to check out the new Outlook?)
