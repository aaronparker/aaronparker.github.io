Following on from the [Windows Server 2008 Component Posters]({{site.baseurl}}/windows/windows-server-2008-component-posters), I've made a nice PNG of just the [NAP](http://www.microsoft.com/nap) component. This does a great job at giving you an overview of how the NAP components work, much easier than trawling though a document. Click on the picture below for a larger view and enjoy:
