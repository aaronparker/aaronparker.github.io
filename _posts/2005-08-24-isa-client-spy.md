Found thisÂ via [Stanislas Quastana's](http://blogs.msdn.com/squasta/archive/2005/08/22/454608.aspx) blog:Â [ISA Client Spy](http://www.isaservertools.com/ISAClientSpy). Free tools for ISA Server are great and this one,Â should be an excellent troubleshooting tool.

>"ISA Client Spy is a FREE utility designed specifically for use with Microsoft ISA Server 2004. With ISA Spy, you can keep an eye on your user's browsing activity in real time.
