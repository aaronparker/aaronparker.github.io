The User Profile Hive Cleanup Service is a tool that I've even been installing on desktops. A beta for version 2.x is underway and [Thomas Koetzing](http://www.thomaskoetzing.de) has an impressive writeup of the tool on his site [here](http://www.thomaskoetzing.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=158&Itemid=246), where you can also sign-up for the beta. Version 2.x sounds great and I hope that all of the features in this new version make it into Vista which a a similar service built in.
