I received a [Citrix X1 Prototype](http://www.citrix.com/go/citrix-mouse.html) mouse a few days ago, so I&#8217;ve put together here a short video that shows paring the mouse and using it in a remote Windows 8 desktop.

The X1 mouse is basically a bluetooth mouse (it should pair with any Bluetooth enabled PC or Mac) that you pair with an iPad - the magic comes with teaming the mouse with [Citrix Receiver R1](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/r1/id491797345?mt=8) (presumably Receiver X1, by the time we get to Citrix Synergy in a couple of weeks). Once paired you&#8217;ll see a mouse cursor in Receiver that works in the remote desktop.

I&#8217;m testing this out with an iPad 4th generation and a [Logitech Ultrathin Bluetooth keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/ultrathin-keyboard-cover) making this a complete thin-client solution (and more) for access to a virtual desktop. The only thing I&#8217;m missing is aÂ [connection to an external monitor](http://store.apple.com/au/product/MD826AM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter), which might make this the ultimate thin-client setup (I can use AirPlay but that just mirrors the iPad screen).

So far I&#8217;m impressed with the setup and the experience is provided with the iPad. I did need to configure the mouse pointer speed to my liking in the remote desktop, so I&#8217;m hoping that Citrix can provide some additional options within Receiver for controlling mouse pointer options in the future.

Here&#8217;s a 2 minute video that shows pairing the mouse and using it a remote Windows 8 desktop:
