A new knowledge base article was published a couple of days ago, that details the NTFS DACL changes in Windows Vista (and Windows Server 2008): [Changes to the default NTFS Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) settings in Windows Vista](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949608)

> In Windows Vista, the NTFS file system Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs) have been changed to enable data sharing and collaboration in data directories that are outside protected directories.

This is a great reference, especially if you are managing co-existence with Windows XP and Windows Vista. It details the default DACL changes in Windows Vista, why these changes were made and how to reset the defaults if you&#8217;ve changed them.
