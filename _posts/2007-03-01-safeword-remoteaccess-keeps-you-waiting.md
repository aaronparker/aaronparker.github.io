If you are ever installing SafeWord RemoteAccess, don&#8217;t be in a hurry. Be prepared to wait while the Setup application downloads the application updates from the SafeWord site, you could be there a while. It&#8217;s clocked just over an hour now and it&#8217;s not my end:

So you don&#8217;t have to go through the pain again, once the download is complete you can find the SafeWord download files here:
