February 8<sup>th</sup> 2013 is the date for the <a href="http://www.amiando.com/appvug2013.html?page=795419" target="_blank">2<sup>nd</sup> European App-V User Group Conference</a>, which will take place at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/6zkzc" target="_blank">Microsoft Netherlands HQ</a> (right next to Schiphol Airport).

The first European App-V User Group in 2011 was a great success also due the overwhelming number of attendants. Over 100 people from 14 different countries took part in the event.



This is the chance to hear from a number of App-V MVPs, including [Falko Gräfe](https://twitter.com/kirk_tn), [Nicke Källén,](https://twitter.com/znackattack) [Ment van der Plas](https://twitter.com/mentvanderplas), [Ruben Spruijt](https://twitter.com/rspruijt), [Jurjen van Leeuwen](https://twitter.com/Leodesk_IT), [Kalle Saunamäki](https://twitter.com/ksaunamaki) and [Rodney Medina](https://twitter.com/Rodney_Medina). In addition, Madelinde Walraven and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sgern/" target="_blank">Sebastian Gernert</a> from Microsoft Support will also be present.

The initiative is focused on bringing people from the App-V community together to learn about Microsoft App-V from the experts and to share experiences and real-world knowledge, plus it will be an excellent opportunity to learn about Microsoft App-V 5.0. The events is sponsored by Login Consultants, but is free from commercial messaging.

If you would like to participate, seats are limited to be sure to <a href="http://www.amiando.com/appvug2013.html?page=795415" target="_blank">register</a> ASAP. See the <a href="http://www.amiando.com/appvug2013.html?page=795416" target="_blank">agenda</a> for a list of all topics for the day.

Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t make it this year - I&#8217;ll be sipping some lagers in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/549Et" target="_blank">Bruges</a>.
