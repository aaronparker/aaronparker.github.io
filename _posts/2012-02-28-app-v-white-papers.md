_Update (28/03/2012)_: This list of white papers are now available on the Microsoft Download Centre: [Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Documentation Resources Download Page](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27760)

Microsoft TechNet recently went through a redesign that seems to have removed some content and in particular a list of App-V white papers that was on the previous [Application Virtualization TechCenter](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/hh710199) no longer exists.

A couple of the white papers are currently available on TechNet, but the full list still includes a number of useful documents that are not. Here's the original list of documents available for download:

      <strong>Microsoft Application Virtualization Version 4.6 SP1 Trial Guide</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top">
      This Trial Guide is designed to help you quickly set up a limited Microsoft® Application Virtualization (App-V) evaluation in a test environment. This guide provides details of the steps necessary to install Microsoft Application Virtualization server components, for both Microsoft Application Virtualization Management Server and Microsoft Application Virtualization Streaming Server. You will install Microsoft Application Virtualization Desktop Client, publish the shortcuts of sequenced applications, and then stream and run these virtual applications on App-V clients. You will learn to virtualize a select set of applications using the Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer. You will also configure clients to run applications in a standalone environment.
