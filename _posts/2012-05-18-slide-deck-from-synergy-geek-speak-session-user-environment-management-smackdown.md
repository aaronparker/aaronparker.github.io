At [Citrix Synergy 2012](http://www.citrixsynergy.com/sanfrancisco/index.html), I had the distinct pleasure of moderating a Geek Speak panel:  &#8220;User Environment Management smackdown 2012&#8221; with [Shawn Bass](http://twitter.com/shawnbass), [Helge Klein](http://twitter.com/helgeklein), [Harry Labana](http://twitter.com/harrylabana) from AppSense, [Bob Janssen](http://twitter.com/bobtopus) from RES Software and [Mike Larkin](http://twitter.com/mlarkin2012) from Citrix on the state of User Environment Management.

Feedback was good and I&#8217;m hoping that we might be able to do something new on this topic in Barcelona later this year.

Unfortunately I don&#8217;t think it was recorded, but if you&#8217;d like to see the slide deck, I&#8217;ve embedded it (via SkyDrive) below:
