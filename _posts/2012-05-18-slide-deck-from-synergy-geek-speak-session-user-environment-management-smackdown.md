At [Citrix Synergy 2012](http://www.citrixsynergy.com/sanfrancisco/index.html), I had the distinct pleasure of moderating a Geek Speak panel:  "User Environment Management smackdown 2012" with [Shawn Bass](http://twitter.com/shawnbass), [Helge Klein](http://twitter.com/helgeklein), [Harry Labana](http://twitter.com/harrylabana) from AppSense, [Bob Janssen](http://twitter.com/bobtopus) from RES Software and [Mike Larkin](http://twitter.com/mlarkin2012) from Citrix on the state of User Environment Management.

Feedback was good and I'm hoping that we might be able to do something new on this topic in Barcelona later this year.

Unfortunately I don't think it was recorded, but if you'd like to see the slide deck, I've embedded it (via SkyDrive) below:
