<img class="size-full wp-image-2911 alignleft" title="homer-doh-128" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/homer-doh-128.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" />If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to look up which Citrix products support a specific database server version, you&#8217;ve attempted to read this article: [CTX114501 &#8211; Supported Databases for Citrix Products](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX114501). You&#8217;ll then have tackled with the product matrix that comes as a PDF instead of something more reasonable like, say, a spread sheet. There&#8217;s probably a good reason for this document to be a PDF, but it&#8217;s not the best format for reading this type of information.

In one of those &#8220;why didn&#8217;t I think of that&#8221; moments, CTP [Timco Hazelaar](https://twitter.com/thazelaar) (and all round good guy) responded to my question to a mailing list about this document in Excel format, by putting the document through a PDF to Excel converter.

I had some mixed results with various online converters, but this one was fairly reasonable: [PDF to Excel](http://www.pdftoexcelonline.com/) by [Nitro PDF](http://www.nitropdf.com/). You can upload a PDF and the site will then convert the file and email you the result. I haven&#8217;t tested the desktop version, but I assume it to be a similar experience.

After conversion, the file still required some cleanup, but the end result is a format more readable and workable than the original. You can view the embedded document here and download for full fidelity.
