  * TechEd was well put together and the content was mostly very good. This was my first since TechEd 2003 in Australia and I was impressed. Quick tip – if you do go to TechEd, get as much sleep as you can over the week as the amount of beer you consume is inversely proportionate to the amount of information you can take in the next day.
  * If you get a Netbook to take notes (like the MSi Wind that I have) be sure to get a 6 cell or a second 3 cell battery so that it can last the day. Madlly searching for power points isn’t much fun.
  * HTC Touch Diamonds and Touch Pros where everywhere, I’m sure they where out-numbering iPhones.
  * VMware had a booth and were even a Gold sponsor, plus they were giving away an iPhone (not Windows Mobile-based phones like everyone else).
  * The number of female delegates was quite high. I don’t have numbers, but this was a good sign – hopefully this number will continue to increase.
  * [Mark Russinovich](http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/), [Jesper Johansson](http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/) and [Steve Riley](http://blogs.technet.com/steriley/) have reached rock star status. It’s an odd thing to see but perhaps warranted – they do present very well.
  * [Mark Minasi](http://www.minasi.com/), [Chris Jackson](http://blogs.msdn.com/cjacks/) and [Aaron Margosis](http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/) are also very good and worth seeing if you get the chance. Chris and Aaron are a nerdy version of the Odd Couple when they present together.
  * People go crazy over the conference satchels. When the organisers where getting rid of the last lot, I saw one guy with 4 of these things and they aren’t something that you would be caught carrying anywhere but TechEd. Well I wouldn’t anyway.
  * Barcelona is a fantastic city. If you get the opportunity to visit, take it. While you are here, I recommend visiting the [Museu d'Història de la Ciutat](http://www.museuhistoria.bcn.es/) (History Museum). There are some very well preserved Roman excavations worth viewing.
