Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) can be downloaded in a number of locations; however you will first require access to these locations which are typically via a paid subscription or because you have paid for licenses.

App-V is available via the following downloads, usually as ISOs:

  * Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP)
  * Application Virtualization for Remote Desktop Services
  * Application Virtualization Hosting for Desktops

Each of the downloads includes the App-V client (either for desktops or RDS hosts), the App-V Sequencer and the App-V Server. Additional downloads available include service packs.

# Microsoft Volume License

If you have purchased the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack or Remote Desktop Services Client Access Licenses (CALs), the downloads will be available to you on the [Microsoft Volume License](https://licensing.microsoft.com) site. Search for "Microsoft Desktop Optimisation Pack" or select 'Software Insurance' under All Products to filter for all Software Assurance downloads.

# Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)

If you have an [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com) subscription, App-V is available via individual downloads for desktops and Remote Desktop Services and in the MDOP ISO. Links to the MSDN downloads are here (sign-in required):
