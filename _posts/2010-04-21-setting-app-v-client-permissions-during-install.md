Most of the [client properties](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc843737.aspx) you&#8217;ll need during install are documented and others are available to set post-install via Group Policy using the [App-V ADM template](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=67CDF9D2-7E8E-4D76-A552-FD82DBBFF9BC&displaylang=en).

However, I generally recommend configuring as many settings as you can during install so that you don&#8217;t have to rely on external tools (e.g. Group Policy) that may not apply in a timely manner.

I have had to set permissions during install to make changes to the default permission set. Those permissions aren&#8217;t documented on TechNet, so I have listed them here.Â The following table lists the permissions that you can modify by passing parameters to Setup or via Windows Installer

[table id=18 /]

See the Property table inside SETUP.MSI for the complete list of additional client settings that you can pass to the installer.

I have included here a complete sample script that deploys the App-V client, by first installing the dependencies and setting permissions (and other options) during install, using the MSI:
