Last Friday turned out to be a pretty awesome day - my wife and I found out we'll be having a girl in July and I've been selected to [receive the Citrix Technology Professional award](http://blogs.citrix.com/2012/03/23/meet-our-newest-citrix-technology-professionals-ctps-3/) for 2012.

I'm extremely honoured to be counted amongst [the list of CTPs](http://community.citrix.com/display/cdn/Citrix+Technology+Professional+Awardees), especially those that I've already met over the past few years. I'm looking forward to meeting the rest in San Francisco in May.

A big thanks to Laura Whalen and the rest of the team at Citrix.
