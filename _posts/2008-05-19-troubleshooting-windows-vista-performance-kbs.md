To get the best out of Windows requires the wipe and load approach when confronted with a slow performing OEM install. I'm working on a post to that effect and [Ed Bott](http://www.edbott.com/weblog/) has [some](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=447) [great](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=437) [articles](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=429) on Windows Vista performance lately (not that I think I'm in Ed Bott's league).

Windows' greatest strength and weakness is the ecosystem that Microsoft has built around it and I think that OEM's aren't doing enough to give consumers the best Windows experience. OEMs should be brought to task for much of Vistas' failings in its first 12 months.

Anyway that's a topic for another day, here's what this post is about - If you are troubleshooting slow performance in Windows Vista, there are some knowledgebase articles that were published last month and are worth referring to for assistance:

  * [How to troubleshoot performance issues with standby, hibernate, and resume in Windows Vista](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950686)
  * [How to troubleshoot performance issues during startup in Windows Vista](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950684)
