To get the best out of Windows requires the wipe and load approach when confronted with a slow performing OEM install. I&#8217;m working on a post to that effect and [Ed Bott](http://www.edbott.com/weblog/) has [some](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=447) [great](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=437) [articles](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=429) on Windows Vista performance lately (not that I think I&#8217;m in Ed Bott&#8217;s league).

Windows&#8217; greatest strength and weakness is the ecosystem that Microsoft has built around it and I think that OEM&#8217;s aren&#8217;t doing enough to give consumers the best Windows experience. OEMs should be brought to task for much of Vistas&#8217; failings in its first 12 months.

Anyway that&#8217;s a topic for another day, here&#8217;s what this post is about &#8211; If you are troubleshooting slow performance in Windows Vista, there are some knowledgebase articles that were published last month and are worth referring to for assistance:

  * [How to troubleshoot performance issues during startup in Windows Vista](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950684)
