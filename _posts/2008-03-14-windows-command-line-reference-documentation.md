<img border="0" alt="CommandLine128" align="left" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/commandline128.png" width="142" height="115" /> There&#8217;s a couple of command line reference documents available on Microsoft Download recently. Via [Aaron Tiensivu](http://blog.tiensivu.com/aaron/archives/1522-Windows-Command-Reference-updated-for-Vista-and-Server-2008.html), there&#8217;s the [Windows Command Reference](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5fb255ff-72da-4b08-a504-1b10266cf72a&displaylang=en) for Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, which curiously doesn&#8217;t include every command line tool in Windows.

For example [SERVERMANAGERCMD](http://stealthpuppy.com/windows/server-managers-power-is-in-the-command-line), in Windows Server 2008, is not included in this document, nor is NETSH. Everything you should need is there including the VBS file included in the OS.

> The Windows command-line tools are used to perform various tasks related to Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008.You can use the command reference to familiarize yourself with new and enhanced command-line tools, to learn about the command shell, and to automate command-line tasks by using batch files or scripting tools.

Today there&#8217;s also the [Windows Server 2008 Network Shell (Netsh) Technical Reference](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f41878de-2ee7-4718-8499-2ef336db3df5&DisplayLang=en), which will be especially handy when [managing networking configuration in Server Core](http://blogs.dirteam.com/blogs/sanderberkouwer/archive/2008/01/25/windows-server-core-ip-configuration-part-1.aspx).

> The Windows ServerÂ® 2008 Network Shell (Netsh) Technical Reference provides a comprehensive command reference for networking technologies such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Network Policy Server (NPS), Network Access Protection (NAP), and Routing and Remote Access Services (RRAS), among many other technologies for which there are netsh commands. Netsh commands offer an alternative to configuring network technologies using the Windows interface. You can run netsh commands in batch files and scripts, and you can run them from the netsh prompt by manually typing commands. You can use netsh commands to configure both local and remote computers.
