I'm here in [Nashville for IGEL Disrupt](https://disrupteuc.com/nashville) over the next few days and I'm looking forward to a number of sessions. While the main event starts on the Tuesday (28th) the first day (Monday 27th) has a couple of sessions on.

As I write this article, I'm sitting in the Windows Virtual Desktop master class lead by Jim Moyle and Christiaan Brinkhoff. This is a 4-hour(!) deep-dive session on WVD that is well attended. This session has some great content that is filling in some gaps for me and the audience engagement is really high.

IGEL has some great support from [sponsors](https://disrupteuc.com/nashville-sponsors/) that speaks to the significance of the event, including several that I certainly pay attention to, for example: Microsoft, Citrix, Control Up, AMD, NVIDIA and VMware.

What's great about this event is that it it's not a "thin-client" conference, instead it's an end-user computing event primarily driven by virtual desktop and DaaS solutions, which of course IGEL becomes a key part of the user experience and endpoint management story.

Here's a quick sample of the [sessions](https://disrupteuc.com/nashville-agenda/) that I'm keen to attend:

* The technology keynote with presenters including [Scott Manchester](https://twitter.com/RDS4U/) from Microsoft and [Nabeel Youakim](https://twitter.com/Nabeely) from Citrix
* [Ruben Spruijt](https://twitter.com/rspruijt) presenting on Nutanix Frame - it will be great to see an update on Frame as I've not looked at it for a couple of years now
* CloudJumper & IGEL - I'm really keen to see CloudJumper's integration with both WVD and IGEL
* IGEL Cloud Gateway on Azure - consistent management of endpoints that could be inside or outside of the corporate network should be high on anyone's endpoint management strategy (regardless of endpoint type)
* Deep Dive into the Design and Technology inside of Citrix Managed Desktop - an insight into the Citrix DaaS services should be fun
* Mastering Your Windows Virtual Desktop Deployment - so far for me, 2020 has been all about WVD. This will keep that theme going
* [DJ Eshelman](https://twitter.com/djeshelman) will present on "The Riskless It Services Methodology: A Simple 4 Step Plan For Your It Projects". It's always great to hear from peers on their non-technology approaches
* AMD are here to talk GPUs with "AMD and IGEL - Thin Client Innovations"
* Lessons Learned from Designing & Implementing a 30K user VMware Horizon RDSH & VDI environment with [Dane Young](https://twitter.com/youngtech)

Over the new few days I'll provide some [updates via Twitter](https://twitter.com/stealthpuppy) on key messages and anything else of value.
