Has Microsoft realised the power of [EventID.Net](http://www.eventid.net)? They've added an '<span id="lblPageHeader"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/support/ee/ee_advanced.aspx">Events and Errors Message Center' </a>page @ TechNet. </span>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p>
    <span>&#8220;To perform an advanced search, enter one or more of the following parameters: Event Id, event source, message text, file name. These values can be found in the Event Viewer logs.&#8221;</span>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<span>Now all they need to add is the same type of community-based input where users can add where they've seen this error message and links to knowledgebase articles. Far more fruitful at times than <a href="http://support.microsoft.com">http://support.microsoft.com</a></span>
