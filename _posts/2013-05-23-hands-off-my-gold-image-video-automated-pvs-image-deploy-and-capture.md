Thanks to everyone who attended my [Geek Speak Live session](https://citrix.g2planet.com/synergylosangeles2013/public_session_view.php?agenda_session_id=274&conference=synergy) at Citrix Synergy 2013 in Anaheim yesterday. I'll post details about the session and the slide deck next week for those who couldn't attend.

In the mean time, here's one of the demos that I ran during the session that shows using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit to deploy WIndows 7 to a target VM and then capture that image into a PVS vDisk, completely hands free (apart from kicking the deployment off, of course).

Hereâ€™s a flow chart that gives an overview of what the script does:

The video is available in HD resolution (720) so you can see the full details.
