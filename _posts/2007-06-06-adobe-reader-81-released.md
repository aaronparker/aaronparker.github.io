Adobe have released version 8.1 of Reader that includes [updates for Office 2007 and Windows Vista](http://itsvista.com/2007/06/acrobat-updated-to-integrate-with-vista-and-office/), including preview in Outlook 2007. I'll update my Adobe Reader deployment tools as soon as I can, ~~however I don't see any reason why ~~[~~my existing transform files~~]({{site.baseurl}}/deployment/disable-adobe-updater-with-adobe-customization-wizard-8)~~ won't work with this version~~ my existing transform files won't work with this version, so expect updates soon. If you are looking to download the latest version here is the direct download link:
