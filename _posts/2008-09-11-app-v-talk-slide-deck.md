The [WMUG](http://wmug.co.uk/default.aspx) meeting was well attended tonight and my talk went better than expected considering that most of what I plan to say goes out the window as soon as I stand at the front of the room (I'm still new to this speaking malarkey).

[Gordon](http://www.inframon.com/) asked if I could post my slide deck, so you can [download that here](http://cid-74b5baa3414de283.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Microsoft%20Application%20Virtualisation%20v2.pptx). The deck is pretty raw so here's some links to more information if you're new to SoftGrid/App-V:

You can get more detail about some of the stuff I went over at that page, including:

  * [Continuity](http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/solutions/continuity.mspx)
  * [Migrations](http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/solutions/migration.mspx)
  * [Terminal Server silos](http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/solutions/sbc.mspx)

There were some interesting questions and discussion points that came up, so I'll try to cover those over the next few days.
