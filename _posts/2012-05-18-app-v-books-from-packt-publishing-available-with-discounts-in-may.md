I've been fortunate enough to have performed technical editor duties on a couple of App-V books by [Augusto Alvarez](http://blog.augustoalvarez.com.ar/) - [Getting Started with Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6](http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-microsoft-application-virtualization-46/book) and [Microsoft Application Virtualization Advanced Guide](http://www.packtpub.com/microsoft-application-virtualization-advanced-guide/book).
