I'm a little slow off the mark here (I've got my head buried in something unrelated), but I've just found out today that the [App-V 4.5 Cumulative Update 1](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/963693), although only available on [Connect](http://connect.microsoft.com), is not actually a beta, it is the final code that you can start deploying.

The MDOP blog [covered this release last month](http://blogs.technet.com/mdop/archive/2009/02/26/get-your-applications-virtualized-on-windows-7-beta-with-microsoft-app-v.aspx), but I think I heard "Windows 7 support" and didn't hear much after that. My bad, I need to pay more attention.

So what is new in CU1 (4.5.1.15580)?

  * Support for Windows 7 Beta and Windows Server 2008 R2 Beta
  * Improved support for sequencing the Microsoft .NET Framework
  * Customer feedback and hotfix rollup (includes [hotfix rollup 3](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961473/) plus some other fixes)
  * Instant access or removal of applications assigned to end users

Get it [from Connect today](https://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=285) or wait until next month when it will be generally available to all (including the TS client which is not available on Connect).
