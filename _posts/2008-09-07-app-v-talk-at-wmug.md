I'm going to be presenting a session on Microsoft Application Virtualisation 4.5 at the [Windows Management User Group](http://wmug.co.uk) this coming Thursday (11th of September) at Microsoft's offices in Victoria here in London:

<div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:84E294D0-71C9-4bd0-A0FE-95764E0368D9:0976db66-16a1-40f0-b4df-bc253dacfb4b" class="wlWriterSmartContent">

</div>

This will be a similar talk to the one I gave at [Vista Squad](http://vistasquad.co.uk/) back [in May](http://vistasquad.co.uk/blogs/scottbelton/archive/2008/05/28/vista-squad-meeting-a-new-hope-tuesday-27th-may.aspx), but since then App-V 4.5 and System Centre Configuration Manager have both gone RTM, so lots more great stuff to cover.

If you're interested in attending, things kick off around 6.30 and you can find details [about the meet and signup at the WMUG web site](http://wmug.co.uk/groups/wmug_event_content/pages/wmug-event-11th-september-2008-cardinal-place-london.aspx).
