Here's an amusing dialog box that was displayed when [Battlefield 2142](http://battlefield.ea.com/battlefield/bf2142/) crashed the other day:

I dare not click Continue since I shouldn't have been there in the first place and I don't know what sort of trouble Try Again would have got me into..

(This one's an entry in the [Hall of Shame](http://www.stealthpuppy.com/blogs/travelling/archive/tags/Hall+of+Shame/default.aspx) because Battlfield crashes on a fairly regular basis, which is just a little more than annoying)
