Advanced Access Control 4.5 includes a session viewer to enable the administrator to view logged in sessions, either directly to Advanced Access Control or view the Acces Gateway (existing versions require you to connect to the Access Gateway desktop to view sessions). Click the link for a full view, note the copy button, this allows you to copy the details of the session to the clipboard.
