Microsoft has written an excellent white paper that explains in detail how the App-V Client and application publishing works. This is a 31 page Word document that is essential reading for anyone who is designing, implementing or administering App-V - [App-V Application Publishing and Client Interaction White Paper](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/7/8/f784a197-73be-48ff-83da-4102c05a6d44/AppPubandClientInteraction.docx) 

The App-V client performs many tasks to present virtual applications that appear to be locally installed to a user.&#160; Often, these tasks are not looked at with the detail that the server components receive.&#160;&#160; In order to effectively support virtual applications, an understanding of the processes performed by the client is imperative.&#160; 

This document will explain the following topics:

  * Important file locations for storing App-V information and data
  * Client cache settings and behaviour
  * Publishing and delivery scenarios
  * Active upgrade
  * Package and data management
  * Client logging
