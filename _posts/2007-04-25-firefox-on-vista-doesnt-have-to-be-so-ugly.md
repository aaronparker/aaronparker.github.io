Because [non-native UI sucks](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000789.html), here's a couple of extensions that help to make Firefox look much better on Windows Vista. These extensions mimic the Internet Explorer 7 interface, including the Windows Vista menus, making Firefox feel far more at home.

  * Install [MyFireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4129) to get the Internet Explorer 7 skin
  * Install [Hide MenuBar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762) to hide the menu bar and display it when you press the Alt key
