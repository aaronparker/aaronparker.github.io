The Short NAP is a (semi-regular) quick list of Microsoft Network Access Protection and Server/Domain Isolation related links from around the web. Here are links for Thursday the 14th of June 2007:

  * [Citrix Acquires NAC Vendor](http://www.cug.co.nz/features/citrixcaymas): Citrix to enter the NAC space. Hopefully they'll see the light when Windows Server 2008 is released, I really wish they wouldn't go down this road.
  * [TechEd US 2007 Day 4: The End of the Booth](http://www.campbellassociates.ca/blog/PermaLink,guid,c8bce9f1-65e1-4992-a500-5e2769452c3e.aspx): There's an interview with Jeff Sigman somewhere, keep an eye on [RunAs Radio](http://www.runasradio.com) for this soon (I hope).
  * [How Microsoft IT Uses Network Access Protection to Manage Network Health (Level 300)](http://www.microsoft.com/events/EventDetails.aspx?CMTYSvcSource=MSCOMMedia&Params=%7eCMTYDataSvcParams%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ID%22+Value%3d%221032339511%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ProviderID%22+Value%3d%22A6B43178-497C-4225-BA42-DF595171F04C%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22lang%22+Value%3d%22en%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22cr%22+Value%3d%22US%22%2f%5e%7esParams%5e%7e%2fsParams%5e%7e%2fCMTYDataSvcParams%5e): This webcast that I noted in a previous Short NAP is now available for offline viewing.
  * [Security and Policy Enforcement: Network Access Protection](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/technet/itsshowtime/sessionh.aspx?videoid=491): Graziano Galante, from Microsoft Italy, speaks about Network Access Protection.
  * [Server and Domain Isolation Data Sheet](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=90&p=&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=179e8815-841a-4bd2-9af6-d5fdf79ce6d0&u=http%3a%2f%2fdownload.microsoft.com%2fdownload%2f0%2f8%2f1%2f0818c854-09b0-4dda-9b8f-89031389e259%2fSDI_Datasheet.doc): This two page document with an overview of server and domain isolation has been updated to version 1.5
  * [Ian Hameroff at TechEd US 2007](http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=5e2e5a37-838f-4ca8-8264-ed128949757a): Ian interviews Rodrigo Immaginario about domain and server isolation at the Universidade de Vila Velha. This is a great video that I recommend watching. I've embedded the video here too:
