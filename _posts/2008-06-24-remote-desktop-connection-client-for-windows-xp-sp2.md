Want the Remote Desktop Connection 6.1 client for Windows XP but can&#8217;t update to [Service Pack 3](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=68C48DAD-BC34-40BE-8D85-6BB4F56F5110&displaylang=en) or Windows Vista? No need to hack files from SP3, just grab the update from here: 

[Update for Windows XP (KB952155)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6e1ec93d-bdbd-4983-92f7-479e088570ad&DisplayLang=en)

> Install this update to use new Terminal Services features on a computer that is running Windows XP Service Pack 2 connecting to computers that are running either Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 operating systems.

There&#8217;s a [MUI pack](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e35296ed-fc0c-43e4-a99d-aec4505d7793&DisplayLang=en) available too. The [knowledge base article for this update](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952155) should be available soon, hopefully. Unfortunately there doesn&#8217;t appear to be an update available for Windows Server 2003.
