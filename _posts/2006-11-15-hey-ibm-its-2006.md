If you&#8217;ve ever downloaded a SCSI or RAID driver for an IBM server from the IBM web site, you&#8217;ll have probably come across the DOS based executable (yes it&#8217;s a 16bit executable) that unpacks the driver to a floppy disk for you. This thing makes you wade through 15 screens of license agreement and then you must agree to said license before it un-packs the driver to a floppy disk.

Now there are at least two problems with this: 1. We don&#8217;t really use floppy disks anymore and 2. On Windows Vista the executable just doesn&#8217;t run &#8211; Windows reports that the executable is invalid. I would love to talk to the person who puts these driver packages together, I bet he still wears, shorts and knee high socks to work (it&#8217;s a North Queensland thing..)
