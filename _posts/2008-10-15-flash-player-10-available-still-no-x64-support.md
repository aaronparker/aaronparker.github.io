Adobe have made [Flash Player 10](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/) [available](http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer), but unfortunately there's still [no support for 64-bit browsers](http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=6b3af6c9&sliceId=2), but then [Silverlight 2](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) doesn't have 64-bit support either.

If you're looking to install Flash Player 10 on Presentation Server/XenApp, make sure you've got [XenApp 5.0](http://support.citrix.com/article/ctx118113) for Windows Server 2008 first or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hotfix </span>[<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">PSE450R02W2K3028</span>](http://support.citrix.com/article/ctx117150) <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for Presentation Server 4.5</span> Hotfix Rollup Pack 3 for XenApp 5.0 and Presentation Server 4.5 ([x86 here](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX115626) and [x64 here](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX115627)).

If it's direct downloads you're after for [deployment in your organisation](http://www.adobe.com/products/players/fpsh_distribution1.html), the same [direct download links work]({{site.baseurl}}/general/looking-for-adobe-flash-player-download-links), just be sure to [apply for a distribution](http://www.adobe.com/products/players/fpsh_distribution1.html#Apply) license before-hand.
