A little more than just Internet Explorer 8 is removable in Windows 7 build 7048. This build allow you to remove Internet Explorer 8, Windows DVD Maker, Windows Media Center, Windows Media Player (no more N editions, I presume) and even Windows Search:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-976" title="windowsfeatures" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/windowsfeatures.png" alt="windowsfeatures" width="523" height="711" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/windowsfeatures.png 523w, https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/windowsfeatures-220x300.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /> 

Given that Windows 7 Enterprise edition will be a superset of Home and Professional, being able to remove these components will be especially welcome for organisations deploying Enterprise edition .

AeroXperience has more on [removing Internet Explorer 8](http://www.aeroxp.org/2009/03/ie8-functionally-removable/) which apparently only removes the IEXPLORE executable; however completely removing Internet Explorer would break compatibility with many applications, so I think calls for being able to remove all traces of IE are just un-realistic.
