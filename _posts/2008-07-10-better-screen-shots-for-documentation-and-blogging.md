There are three tools that I use for creating and managing screen shots for documentation and posting here on my blog:

  * [Windows Clippings](http://www.windowclippings.com/) 
  * [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) 
  * [PNGOUT](http://www.advsys.net/ken/utils.htm) 

Now I can't claim that I discovered these tools myself and they've been covered elsewhere probably more eloquently, but I think they're worth pointing out again. Of course, what works for me might not work for you, but I use these tools daily and would have a hard time getting by without them.

## Taking Screen Shots with Window Clippings

If you're still using the Print Screen button or the Snipping tool in Windows Vista, I recommend taking a look at [Window Clippings](http://www.windowclippings.com/) instead. There's a lot to like about Window Clippings:

  * It comes as a single executable (32-bit and 64-bit), no installation required
  * It captures the window shadow in Windows Vista for better looking screen shots
  * It has a simple intuitive interface
  * It's integrated nicely with Windows Vista (uses the correct fonts, UI paradigms etc)
  * It works well with [OneNote](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/default.aspx) and Paint.NET
  * It's licensed to you, not for each machine you want to run it on

Window Clippings gives me great screen shots like this:

I could also capture [multiple windows](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2008/04/05/window-clippings-2-1-how-to-select-multiple-windows.aspx), [parent windows](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2008/04/09/window-clippings-2-1-how-to-include-a-disabled-parent-window.aspx), or even [menus](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2008/04/10/window-clippings-2-1-how-to-capture-menus-and-other-interactive-effects.aspx). I loved it so much I even bought a license, which I think brings the number of software products I own licenses for to three.

## Editing Screen Shots with Paint.NET

I use [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) to make edits to any of my images. Since Windows Clippings can output directly to Paint.NET, I can take a screen shot and immediately start editing it in Paint.NET. I also use this tool for creating the icons I place in some posts. So whilst it's not the most full featured graphic editing tool, it does everything I need.

There's a lot to like about Paint.NET too:

  * It's completely free, although you are encouraged to [donate](http://www.getpaint.net/donate.html) to help development
  * It's actively developed and has a small footprint
  * It's integrated nicely with Windows Vista (uses the correct fonts, dialog boxes, UI paradigms etc)
  * It has all the [features](http://www.getpaint.net/features.html) required for editing screen shots (and more) without resorting to pirating Photoshop
  * It has an [active forum](http://paintdotnet.forumer.com/index.php) with many people writing plug-ins for it

Here's Paint.NET editing the previous screen shot:

Given that Paint.NET is maintained by a bunch of Microsoft devs, it would be great to see this or a derivative in Windows 7.

## Optimising Screen Shots with PNGOUT

[PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) is my file type of choice for screen shots because it looks great and still manages to keep files sizes small. But as [Jeff Atwood points out](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000810.html), you can use [PNGOUT](http://www.advsys.net/ken/utils.htm) to squeeze the file sizes down further. In the screen shot below you can see the size difference between the before and after optimisation on the Computer screen shot above. 

<img title="PngOut" height="203" alt="PngOut" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pngout.png" width="567" border="0" /> 

The file has been reduce to 77% of the original size. Great for reducing my bandwidth requirements, but also excellent for keep my documents smaller too. You can read more about [using PNGOUT here](http://www.advsys.net/ken/util/pngout.htm).

Although PNGOUT is a command line tool, you can make life easier by adding a shortcut to your Send To menu or using a GUI wrapper like [PNGGauntlet](http://brh.numbera.com/software/pnggauntlet/).

### Wrapping Up

So that's what I use and you can't argue with great results - don't settle for second rate screen shots. I'll leave you with a few more pointers:

  * Please spare us (or maybe just me) from that awful shadow Windows Live Writer adds to images. It's just plain ugly.
  * Always use the default Windows themes when creating screen shots for documentation. There's a good chance your audience may not recognise that custom theme as anything close to what they're seeing on their own machine.
  * Apparently you should [disable ClearType when taking screen shots for documentation](http://blogs.msdn.com/msdnmagazine/archive/2007/01/23/1516308.aspx). I haven't found this to be an issue yet, but then I don't write for a magazine.
