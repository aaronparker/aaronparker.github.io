Don't call it a service pack, but what's a service pack by any other name? Seems it's a "Supportability Update". Microsoft have released an update for ISA Server 2006 that brings the features that ISA Server 2004 got with Service Pack 3. Here's the breakdown of what's included:

  * All software updates issued since ISA Server 2006 was released to manufacturing.
  * Improved log viewer functionality, including an enhanced details pane view, text coloring, and new log filtering functionality.
  * Updated ISA Server Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in functionality that provides access to troubleshooting tools and options available directly from the ISA Server Management console.
  * Integration with the Microsoft ISA Server Best Practices Analyzer Tool. For more information, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=79754.
  * New diagnostic logging functionality.
