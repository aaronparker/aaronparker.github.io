Instead of waiting for Citrix to support Windows Vista icon sizes in their new beta client, I&#8217;ve updated it myself. I&#8217;ll bet the Mac OS X client gets a full size icon (Leopard supports 512 x 512 pixels). Why does Vista have to be a second class citizen?

Here&#8217;s the before and after shots:

</p>

I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree that &#8216;after&#8217; looks much better. The crazy thing is that I&#8217;ve added the 256 x 256 PNG file that I originally downloaded from the official Citrix blogs site (I&#8217;ve lost the original link).

You can download the icon from [here](http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/CitrixApplications.ico) and update your existing shortcuts or break out a resource editor to update the executables directly. Here&#8217;s the original PNG file if you want to cook your own.

I&#8217;m going to try to be optimistic and I know this is a beta product, but I&#8217;m not going to bet on Vista icon support in the final release.
