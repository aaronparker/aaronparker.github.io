Instead of waiting for Citrix to support Windows Vista icon sizes in their new beta client, I've updated it myself. I'll bet the Mac OS X client gets a full size icon (Leopard supports 512 x 512 pixels). Why does Vista have to be a second class citizen?

Here's the before and after shots:

<p align="center">
  <img border="0" alt="CitrixApplicationsIconBeforeAndAfter" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/2008/05/citrixapplicationsiconbeforeandafter.png" width="168" height="352" />
</p>

I'm sure you'll agree that 'after' looks much better. The crazy thing is that I've added the 256 x 256 PNG file that I originally downloaded from the official Citrix blogs site (I've lost the original link).

You can download the icon from [here]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2008/05/CitrixApplications.ico) and update your existing shortcuts or break out a resource editor to update the executables directly. Here's the original PNG file if you want to cook your own.

  <img border="0" alt="CitrixApplicationsIcon" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/2008/05/citrixapplicationsicon.png" width="168" height="168" />
</p>

I'm going to try to be optimistic and I know this is a beta product, but I'm not going to bet on Vista icon support in the final release.
