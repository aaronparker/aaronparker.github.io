There are a number of diagnostic and troubleshooting features in Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) and we show how to use them to roll out and leverage your App-V deployment. For example, the App-V sequencer will virtualize the majority of the applications thrown at it, but sometimes you will need to use some advanced features to complete creating a virtual package for a complex app. We show you how to use built-in log files and external tools such as Procmon to understand why a virtual package is not working as expected and how to make changes to enable it to work as expected...
