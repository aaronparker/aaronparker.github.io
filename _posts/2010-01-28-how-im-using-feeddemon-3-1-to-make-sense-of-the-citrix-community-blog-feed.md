I’ve been a fan of FeedDemon for several years now and was even a paying customer of the 2.x version, so this post is a little biased – you may be able to do something similar in other feed readers.

I find subscribing to feeds at the [Citrix Blogs](http://community.citrix.com/blogs) site just a little vexing. I could just be doing it all wrong, however there is essentially what amounts to a single RSS feed delivered by the site. The concept of a feed for each Citrite or product blog doesn’t appear to exist.

You do have the opportunity to subscribe feeds such as the [XenDesktop feed](http://feeds.citrix.com/officialcitrixblog/group/xen-desktop) and the [XenApp feed](http://feeds.citrix.com/officialcitrixblog/group/xenapp), but these aren’t really separate feeds, they are feeds for each tag (i.e. the XenDesktop and the XenApp tags). Because many posts are tagged with multiple tags (and quite often a tag unrelated to the topic), you’ll end up many repeated entries in your feed reader. Like this:

As you can see it can get a little over the top at times.

Thankfully, [FeedDemon](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx)&#160;[3.1 has come](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/introducing-feeddemon-31.html) to my rescue with Content Filters. Now I can subscribe to the single [Citrix Blogs feed](http://community.citrix.com/blogs/rss) and just filter out the posts that don’t interest me. Here you can see that I’m filtering out posts about Branch Repeater and NetScaler which I don’t do anything with.

Although at this time, this feature isn’t supported in Google Reader or [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWireiPhone/Default.aspx), applied to the Citrix feed I end up with something much more manageable. Thank-you [Mr Bradbury](http://nick.typepad.com/) you’ve made my day. :).

Right, so now I’m off to do that same with the [Ars Technica](http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/everything) and Engadget feeds – maybe I can filter out some of the iPad hype for a couple of days.
