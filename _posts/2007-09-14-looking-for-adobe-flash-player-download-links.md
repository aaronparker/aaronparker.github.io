<span style="color: #ff0000;">Update</span> [November 2011]: Adobe has released Flash Player 11 in both 32-bit and 64-bit packages. The links below will only  provide you with Flash Player 10. To obtain the installers for Flash Player 11, see the following articles:

  * [Flash Player enterprise deployment](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/enterprise_deployment.html)
  * [Distribute Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/products/players/fpsh_distribution1.html)

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

Listed here are the links for the latest installers for the Adobe Flash and Shockwave Players. Each link will always result in the latest version of each player.

### Adobe Flash Player

  * <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/full_flashplayer_win_msi" target="_blank">Flash Player 10 for Internet Explorer MSI Installer</a>
  * <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/full_flashplayer_win_ie" target="_blank">Flash Player 10 for Internet Explorer EXE Installer</a>
  * <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/full_flashplayer_win_pl_msi" target="_blank">Flash Player 10 for Firefox/Mozilla MSI Installer</a>
  * <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/full_flashplayer_win" target="_blank">Flash Player 10 for Firefox/Mozilla EXE Installer</a>

<div>
  To deploy Flash Player, follow these guides: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player_admin_guide.html">Adobe Flash Player Administration Guide for Flash Player 10.1</a> and <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/167/16701594.html">Configure Flash Player auto-update notification</a>
</div>

### Adobe Shockwave Player

  * <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/sw_full_exe_installer" target="_blank">Shockwave Player 11 for EXE Installer</a>
  * <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/sw_msi_installer" target="_blank">Shockwave Player 11 for MSI Installer</a>

To deploy Shockwave Player silently, follow this guide: [Silent installation and configurations of Shockwave player](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/195/tn_19572.html)

If you're unsure which installer to download, grab the MSI installers. If you are downloading the players to distribute them in your corporate network you must [obtain a license from Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/licensing/) before doing so.

Here's a link to the original [unattend install script for these players](http://stealthpuppy.com/unattended/unattended-install-adobe-flash-and-shockwave-players) that started this and here's [how to uninstall Flash Player](http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_14157&sliceId=2) if you're having issues updating to the lastest version.
