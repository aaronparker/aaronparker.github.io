Mitchell Ashley over at [The Converging Network](http://www.theconvergingnetwork.com/), has [a podcast with a discussion with Amith Krishnan](http://www.theconvergingnetwork.com/2006/11/podcast_22_microsoft_nap_with_1.html) from Microsoft about NAP:

> Amrith joins Alan and me to get in depth about NAP and how Microsoft is delivering NAP in Vista and Longhorn. We also talk about Microsoft's plans to make the NAP APIs available for 3rd parties to create non-Windows NAP agents. The Microsoft NAP and Cisco NAC announcement gets some scrutiny and we work really hard to pin down Amrith on Microsoft's plans for TCG/TNC support (you'll be very interested in what he has to say about TNC). Overall I think Amrith was very forthcoming about NAP and our podcast listeners will find this interview extremely interesting. This isn't your typical corporate PR sanitized interview.

Mitchell Ashley is CTO and VP Customer Experience at [StillSecure](http://www.stillsecure.com/), who create [Safe Control](http://www.stillsecure.com/safeaccess/index.php), a network access control product, so expect to see some integration with NAP. You can listen to the discussion from the 14:52 to 37:33 minute marks. Here's a quick bullet point overview of what is discussed:

  * Introduction
  * What is NAP?
  * NAP components
  * NAP and Cisco ACS/NAC
  * Clients for Windows XP/Windows 2000
  * Clients for non-Windows OSs
