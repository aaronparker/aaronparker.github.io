This came out of the blue (or perhaps I haven’t been paying attention). Here’s the [Microsoft Application Virtualization Best Practices Analyzer](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1a091960-1c9f-4bfc-9247-284e83c07d02&DisplayLang=en):

> The Application Virtualization (App-V) Best Practices Analyzer is a diagnostic tool that verifies configuration settings for a computer running a Microsoft Application Virtualization Streaming Server version 4.5 or Microsoft Application Virtualization Management Server version 4.5.  
> Feature Bullet Summary:
> 
>   * Scans Microsoft Application Virtualization Streaming Server
>   * Scans Microsoft Application Virtualization Management Server
>   * Reports warnings and guidance for configuration settings that should be adjusted
>   * Produces an HTML report with all errors and warnings

It’s a command line tool that you’ll need to install and run on your Management or Streaming Server. To use this, you’ll first need to install the [Microsoft Baseline Configuration Analyzer](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=DB70824D-ABAE-4A92-9AA2-1F43C0FA49B3&displaylang=en).

The [Microsoft Application Virtualization Administrative Template (ADM Template)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=67cdf9d2-7e8e-4d76-a552-fd82dbbff9bc&DisplayLang=en) has also been released to the Downloads Centre, so if you haven’t been able to get a hold of it previously, now you can.
