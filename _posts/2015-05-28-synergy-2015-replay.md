Citrix have made available the recording of [our session](https://stealthpuppy.com/citrix-synergy-2015/) at Synergy 2015 in Orlando - [I've Got 99 Problems and Folder Redirection is Every One of Them](https://www.mycugc.org/p/do/sd/sid=25). This is a standard 45-minute, level 400 session. [Shawn](https://twitter.com/shawnbass) and I will be repeating this as [a 75-minute session at BriForum Denver](http://briforum.com/US/sessions.html) with additional content and testing scenarios.

As a part of the Geek Speak Live track at Synergy 2015, this was the first time that these sessions have been recorded. Previous to this year, no recordings were made available.

Going forward all of the Geek Speak sessions will be made available the new [Citrix User Group Community](https://www.mycugc.org/p/do/sd/sid=25) (CUGC) site, so if you didn't get to Synergy or unable to attend one of the Geek Speak sessions while you where there, [you can catch up with all of them](https://www.mycugc.org/p/do/si/topic=18) over at the new community site.

To watch these you'll need to sign up for the CUGC site, so you can take full advantage of the additional great content there and contribute to the wider Citrix community.
