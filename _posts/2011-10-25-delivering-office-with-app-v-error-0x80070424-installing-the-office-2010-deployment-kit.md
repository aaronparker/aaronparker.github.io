If you have issues installing the [Office 2010 Deployment Kit for App-V](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=10386) (OffVirt.msi) to install the licensing component for a virtualized Office 2010 package, it may fail to install. A typical command line to install the licensing component look like this:

[code]START /WAIT MSIEXEC /I OffVirt.msi PROPLUS=1 PROJECTPRO=1 VISIOPRO=1[/code]

However, by default OffVirt.msi runs silently and offers no errors, so to troubleshoot we need to log the install to a file (using the /l*v switch). In the log, you might find lines similar to the following:

[code]CAInstallLicenses: OMSICA : Initializing CustomAction CAInstallLicenses  
CAInstallLicenses: Populating the Token Store  
CAInstallLicenses: Installing license: sl.RAC.GENERIC.PRIVATE  
CAInstallLicenses: Error: Failed to open Token Store HResult: 0x80070424.[/code]

Toward the end of the log, the Windows Installer will report a return code of 1603:

[code]CustomAction CAInstallLicenses returned actual error code 1603 (note this may not be 100% accurate if translation happened inside sandbox)[/code]

Fortunately the fix is easy â€“ ensure the correct OffVirt.msi for your target platform is used. Windows x86 requires the 32-bit version and Windows x64 requires the 64-bit version. Note that the version of OffVirt.msi that you use is for the target Windows platform, not the Office 2010 package you have sequenced.
