I&#8217;ve modified my blogs&#8217; feed to use [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/) instead of the internal RSS/Atom feeds to make feeds nice and consistent and hopefully work well across all fead readers. It also lets me track subscriptions better than [Community Server](http://www.communityserver.org/) and actually works with [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/). Most feed readers should automagically redirect to the new feed and all should be good, so if your reading this post in a feed reader, it worked! If you aren&#8217;t, it hasn&#8217;t worked for you and I can only say sorry, but of course you won&#8217;t be reading this anyway... Hmm, man I hope this works out.

Here&#8217;s the new feed URL: <http://feeds.feedburner.com/travellingwithoutmoving>, otherwise the syndication links on the left connect to the same place.
