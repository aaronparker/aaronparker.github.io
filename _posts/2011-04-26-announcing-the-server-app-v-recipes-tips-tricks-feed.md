I've previously written about the [Desktop App-V Recipes, Tips and Tricks list](https://stealthpuppy.com/virtualisation/200-app-v-recipes-tips-and-tricks-to-keep-you-busy/) that fellow App-V MVP, [Nicke Källén](http://www.viridisit.se/eng/blog/) and I have been compiling over the past year. This list has recently reached well over 220 links and highlights the fantastic efforts of many different contributors.

Now that Server App-V is publicly available in preview and [server application recipes](http://blogs.technet.com/b/serverappv/archive/2011/04/26/sequencing-petshop-4.aspx) are being published, it's time to start compiling the [Server App-V Recipes, Tips and Tricks](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ServerAppVRecipes) list. Like the Desktop App-V list, this is an RSS feed that you can use to stay up to date with Server App-V links from around the Internets.

[The list](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ServerAppVRecipes) currently sits at 1 and I don't think we'll be at 220 this time next year, but I'm keen to see how this one progresses.
