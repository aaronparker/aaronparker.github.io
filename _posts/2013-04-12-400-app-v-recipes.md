With thanks to [Nicke's latest post](http://www.applepie.se/teamviewer-8-licensing-and-app-v), the [App-V Recipes and Tips list]({{site.baseurl}}/appvrecipes/) has hit 400 links!

If you haven't seen this list previously, this is the place to find recipes, tips, workaround and fixes for various applications that the community has built around Microsoft App-V. A big thanks to all those community members who have contributed to this list and shared their knowledge.

If you'd like to keep up to date, as links are added, there's [an RSS feed for the list](http://feeds.feedburner.com/appvrecipes), and the list itself is searchable (here's an example for [Firefox recipes](https://delicious.com/search?p=Firefox%2CAppVRecipe)).

Here's to the next 400.
