With thanks to [Nicke&#8217;s latest post](http://www.applepie.se/teamviewer-8-licensing-and-app-v), the [App-V Recipes and Tips list](http://stealthpuppy.com/appvrecipes/) has hit 400 links!

If you haven&#8217;t seen this list previously, this is the place to find recipes, tips, workaround and fixes for various applications that the community has built around Microsoft App-V. A big thanks to all those community members who have contributed to this list and shared their knowledge.

If you&#8217;d like to keep up to date, as links are added, there&#8217;s [an RSS feed for the list](http://feeds.feedburner.com/appvrecipes), and the list itself is searchable (here&#8217;s an example for [Firefox recipes](https://delicious.com/search?p=Firefox%2CAppVRecipe)).

Here&#8217;s to the next 400.
