The Short NAP is a (semi-regular) quick list of Microsoft Network Access Protection and Server/Domain Isolation related links from around the web. Here are links for Thursday the 31st of May 2007:

  * [An Introduction to Network Access Protection (Part 7)](http://www.windowsnetworking.com/articles_tutorials/Introduction-Network-Access-Protection-Part7.html): Brian Posey's latest installment in his detailed introduction to Network Access Protection. Curiously at the end of the article he mentions "I have heard a few rumors that Windows XP may eventually be retrofit to support NAP". This is an odd statement given that the NAP client for Windows XP is currently in beta and has been for some time.
  * [Microsoft Takes Aim at Endpoint](http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=124942): Dark Reading covers the Intelligent Application Gateway Service Pack 1 with future support for NAP.
  * [TechNet Webcast: How Microsoft IT Uses Network Access Protection to Manage Network Health (Level 300)](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032339510&EventCategory=4&culture=en-US&CountryCode=US): Kevin Rhodes will present on the internal use of NAP at Microsoft on June 12. I'll be asleep when this is on, so I'll have to catch up when the webcast is available offline.
  * [Introducing Windows Server 2008](http://blogs.technet.com/canitpro/archive/2007/05/15/guest-blogger-it-s-official-windows-server-2008.aspx): The first Microsoft Press book off the ranks on Windows Server 2008 will include a chapter devoted to NAP.
  * [FullArmor Endpoint Policy Manager Ships](http://rcpmag.com/news/article.aspx?editorialsid=8345): FullArmor have released their product for [enforcing endpoint policies](http://www.fullarmor.com/products-fullarmor-endpoint-policy-manager.htm) with integration into NAP.
  * [University Uses Existing Windows Investments to Tighten Network Security and Management](http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=49593): A case study on the Universidade de Vila Velha using domain isolation to help protect their network. Also check out this [article by Rodrigo Immaginario](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/secmvp/sv0906.mspx) the university's CIO. Via [Ian Hameroff](http://blogs.technet.com/ianhamer/archive/2007/05/29/teched-2007-security-track-goes-on-line.aspx).
  * [Exploring The Windows Firewall](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/06/VistaFirewall/default.aspx): Steve Riley takes a look at the Windows Firewall in Windows Vista.
