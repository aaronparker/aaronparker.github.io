There's a particular behaviour in Outlook for Mac, that for several years I have thought was a bug.Â If you reply to an email, you often only get some of the text from the original email, rather than the entire email being copied into the reply. Like this:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3814" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outook-QuotedText.png" alt="Outook-QuotedText" width="1020" height="757" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outook-QuotedText.png 1020w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outook-QuotedText-150x111.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outook-QuotedText-300x223.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outook-QuotedText-624x463.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /> 

This week (after having a Mac for almost 4 years) I stumbled across the reason. It turns out that if you select text in the original email, only that text is quoted.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3813" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outlook-OriginalEmail.png" alt="Outlook-OriginalEmail" width="1090" height="795" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outlook-OriginalEmail.png 1090w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outlook-OriginalEmail-150x109.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outlook-OriginalEmail-300x219.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outlook-OriginalEmail-1024x747.png 1024w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2015/01/Outlook-OriginalEmail-624x455.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px" /> 

The feature has been there since at least Outlook for Mac 2011 and is there still in the latest Outlook for Mac. Certainly different behaviour to Outlook on Windows.

Unfortunately there is no way to disable the feature, so something to look out for in the future, now that I know what the cause is.
