This is a great article discussing the features of ISA Server as a layer 7 firewall (without the usual zealous bubbleÂ from Dr T. Shinder)

**The Industry Insiders: Securing the network using Microsoft ISA Server 2004**

Whilst on the subject of layer 7 &#8211; here&#8217;s why outbound HTTP/S should be authenticated (and users should not have admin access to their workstations)- _HTTP Tunnels_:

[HTTP Tunnel](http://www.http-tunnel.com/)Â  (I think this one is particularly insidious, because they sell it as a &#8220;service&#8221;, lets hope the CEO does&#8217;nt stumble across this site)  
[Zebedee](http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/)

HTTP tunnel software allows for tunneling almost any protocol over HTTP. For example, a user could use a HTTP tunnel to bypass the firewall to use their peer-to-peer software and download stuff from the Internet.
