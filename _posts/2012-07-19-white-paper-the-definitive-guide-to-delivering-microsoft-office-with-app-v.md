Using application virtualization to simplify your gold image by delivering what&#8217;s most likely the most common component of any image - Microsoft Office, continues to be a popular topic. But is it the right approach?

Microsoft has some great guidance on using App-V 4.6 to deliver various versions of Office, but there&#8217;s no single place that brings them together with a discussion on what you need to consider before virtualizing Office. This is where community discussion can help.

I&#8217;m extremely happy to make this white paper available, which is the result of a lot of time and effort and a companion piece to [a talk that I gave at BriForum London back in May](http://stealthpuppy.com/community/briforum-talk-office-and-app-v/).

The paper is divided into two parts:

  * _Part 1: To virtualize or not to virtualize_ - a discussion on the pros and cons of  virtualizing Office and what you should be considering if you are going to virtualize Office rather than deliver it as a component of your core gold image
  * _Part 2: Virtualizing Office with App-V_ - a detailed walkthrough that goes beyond the Microsoft documentation for sequencing and delivering Office 2010, 2007 and 2003 with App-V 4.6

The aim of this document is to be the best resource for virtualizing Office 2010, 2007 and 2003 with App-V 4.6 SP1 & SP2 available. Feedback, corrections and criticisms are welcome.
