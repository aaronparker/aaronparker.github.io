![The Definitive Guide to Virtualizing Office header]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-18-at-13.52.51.png)

Using application virtualization to simplify your gold image by delivering what's most likely the most common component of any image - Microsoft Office, continues to be a popular topic. But is it the right approach?

Microsoft has some great guidance on using App-V 4.6 to deliver various versions of Office, but there's no single place that brings them together with a discussion on what you need to consider before virtualizing Office. This is where community discussion can help.

I'm extremely happy to make this white paper available, which is the result of a lot of time and effort and a companion piece to [a talk that I gave at BriForum London back in May]({{site.baseurl}}/community/briforum-talk-office-and-app-v/).

[Download the whitepaper]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads/2012/07/The-Definitive-Guide-to-Delivering-Microsoft-Office-with-App-V-1.01.pdf)

The paper is divided into two parts:

* _Part 1: To virtualize or not to virtualize_ - a discussion on the pros and cons of  virtualizing Office and what you should be considering if you are going to virtualize Office rather than deliver it as a component of your core gold image
* _Part 2: Virtualizing Office with App-V_ - a detailed walkthrough that goes beyond the Microsoft documentation for sequencing and delivering Office 2010, 2007 and 2003 with App-V 4.6

The aim of this document is to be the best resource for virtualizing Office 2010, 2007 and 2003 with App-V 4.6 SP1 & SP2 available. Feedback, corrections and criticisms are welcome.
