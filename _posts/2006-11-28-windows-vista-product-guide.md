Microsoft have posted **the** Windows Vista Product Guide on their Downloads Centre. At 61Mb and 316 pages this document is huge, but it&#8217;s go some great detail about what Windows Vista is all about. If you&#8217;re one of those people who thinks that Windows Vista is Windows XP Service Pack 3, then this document is for you, if you&#8217;re not, then this document is still for you too. This is the document to give to your sales team (you may have to read it to them &#8211; could take a while and you might need a little bell handy to let them know when to turn the page..). Here&#8217;s a break down of what the document covers:

  * Section 1: Introduction to Windows Vista
  * Section 2: Windows Vista Edition
  * Section 3: For All Users
  * Section 4: For Home Users
  * Section 5: For Business Users
  * Section 6: For IT Professionals
  * Section 7: Appendix

The document comes in Word 2007 and XPS formats, so you&#8217;ll need either the [Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&displaylang=en), if you don&#8217;t already have Word 2007, or [MSXML 6.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=993C0BCF-3BCF-4009-BE21-27E85E1857B1&displaylang=en) and the [XML Paper Specification Essentials Pack](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=4A7B8983-7BE1-4740-BC9C-D377A8F2D6EB&displaylang=en), if you&#8217;re not already running Windows Vista, to view it:

Another interesting download posted today is the [Microsoft Windows Vista Readiness Assessment tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5cafd2ab-2397-45eb-81b1-9e915c157485&DisplayLang=en), although at the moment, it looks to me like someone hasn&#8217;t finished uploading the correct files. There are only XML files available for download &#8211; no WSSADS.EXE link, which should contain the assessment tool. Keep an eye on this one for updates:

> The Windows Vista Readiness Assessment (WVRA) is an automated tool designed for customers and parters to quickly assess network-wide their PCs&#8217; readiness for Windows Vista. It provides detailed reporting on hardware and device driver compatibility for upgrades to Windows Vista:

UPDATE: The Vista Readiness Assessment tool has been removed from the Download Centre. Keep an eye out for a re-release some time soon.
