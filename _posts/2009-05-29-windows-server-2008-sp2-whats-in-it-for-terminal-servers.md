As you&#8217;re most likely aware, Microsoft has recently made available [Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a4dd31d5-f907-4406-9012-a5c3199ea2b3&DisplayLang=en). If you would like to know the details of every single fix and feature in the service pack, download this spreadsheet: [Hotfix and Security Update List: Windows Server 2008 SP2 and Windows Vista SP2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=d8b2cf4b-a2df-4664-8dd8-e840001e33f3).
