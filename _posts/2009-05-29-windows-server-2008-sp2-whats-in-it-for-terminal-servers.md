As you're most likely aware, Microsoft has recently made available [Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a4dd31d5-f907-4406-9012-a5c3199ea2b3&DisplayLang=en). If you would like to know the details of every single fix and feature in the service pack, download this spreadsheet: [Hotfix and Security Update List: Windows Server 2008 SP2 and Windows Vista SP2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=d8b2cf4b-a2df-4664-8dd8-e840001e33f3).

What's always interesting to me is what is in the latest service packs that will directly benefit Terminal Servers. The table below lists all of the hotfixes in SP2 that directly relate to Terminal Services, and it's quite the list. So it's time to get testing and deploying:
