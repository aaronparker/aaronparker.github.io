I shared a lightning round session at BriForum London 2012 with [Dan Brinkmann](http://twitter.com/dbrinkmann). I rolled two lightning rounds (including [Should Office Be in the Base Image?](http://briforum.com/Europe/sessions.html#officebaseimage)) into one with [The Definitive Guide to delivering Office with App-V](http://briforum.com/Europe/sessions.html#deployingmsoffice).

We were very lucky to have a great turn out considering the strong competition in the other sessions for that slot. Thanks to those who attended, it was very much appreciated.

If you're interested in taking a look at the slide deck, I've embedded ([via SkyDrive](http://sdrv.ms/KiNCm7)) it below:
