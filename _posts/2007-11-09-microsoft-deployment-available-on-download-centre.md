[Microsoft Deployment](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3bd8561f-77ac-4400-a0c1-fe871c461a89&DisplayLang=en) looks to have made it&#8217;s way to version 1.0 and is available on Microsoft&#8217;s Download Centre. There&#8217;s no real confirmation that this is the RTM/RTW release but it&#8217;s just been posted so I can only assume.

> Microsoft Deployment is the next version of Business Desktop Deployment (BDD) 2007. It is the recommended process and toolset to automate desktop and server deployment. Microsoft Deployment provides detailed guidance and job aids for every organizational role involved with large-scale deployment projects.
