The independent R&D project ‘[Virtual Reality Check](http://www.projectvrc.com)’ (VRC) was started in early 2009 by Ruben Spruijt ([@rspruijt](https://twitter.com/rspruijt)) of PQR and Jeroen van de Kamp ([@thejeroen](https://twitter.com/thejeroen)) of Login Consultants, and focuses on research in the desktop and application virtualization market. Several white papers with [Login VSI](http://www.loginvsi.com) test results were published about the performance and best practices of different hypervisors, Microsoft Office versions, application virtualization solutions, Windows Operating Systems in server hosted desktop solutions and the impact of antivirus in VDI environments.

In 2013 and early 2014, Project VRC released the annual &#8216;State of the VDI and SBC union' community survey (download for free at <a class="" href="http://www.projectvrc.com/white-papers" target="">www.projectvrc.com/white-papers</a>). Over 1300 people participated. The results of this independent and unique survey have provided many new insights into desktop virtualization usage around the world.

This year Project VRC would like to repeat this survey to see how our industry has changed and to take a look at the future of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure and Server Based Computing in 2015. To do this they need your help again. Everyone who is involved in building or maintaining VDI or SBC environments is invited to participate in this survey.

The questions of this survey are both functional and technical and range from “What are the most important design goals set for this environment”, to “Which storage is used”, to “How are the VM’s configured”. The 2015 VRC survey will only take 10 minutes of your time.

The success of the survey will not only be determined by the number of the responses, but also by the quality of those responses. This led Project VRC to the conclusion that they should stay away from giving away free stuff to survey participants and instead, opt for the following strategy: only survey participants will receive the exclusive overview report with all results immediately after the survey closes.

The survey will be closed **February 15th** this year. I really hope you want to participate and enjoy the official Project VRC “State of the VDI and SBC union 2015” survey!
