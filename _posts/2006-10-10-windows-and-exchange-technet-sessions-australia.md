[Microsoft Australia are hosting a TechNet session](http://blogs.technet.com/itproaustralia/archive/2006/10/10/Windows-Server-_2200_Longhorn_2200_-and-Exchange-Server-2007-upcoming-TechNet-sessions.aspx) on Windows Server &#8220;Longhorn&#8221; and Exchange Server 2007 in Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Sydney. The second part of the session is all about Network Access Protection:

> Part 2, 60 mins: Windows Server &#8220;Longhorn&#8221;: Getting ready for NAP  
> With the push towards mobile work environments IT Administrators face the daily risk of notebook PC&#8217;s infecting other machines in corporate network after they have potentially been used in uncontrolled environments like home networks and wireless hotspots. Network Access Protection in Longhorn Server will provide quarantine services designed to ensure that these machines comply to corporate policy as they re-enter the network. This session provides an overview of what the technology provides, how you get ready for it and what you need to do to configure it.
