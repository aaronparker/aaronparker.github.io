I spend alot of time troubleshooting applications on Windows XP and Windows Terminal Server. The challenge, especially in Terminal Server environments is to get applications running and still keep the environment secure. This means spending time with the [Sysinternals](http://www.sysinternals.com/) tools and various others. Brian Madden has started posting videos and presentations from this years [BriForum](http://www.briforum.com/). The first video and slide deck are a great resource for those of us who deploy and manage applications. Definitely worth a watch:
