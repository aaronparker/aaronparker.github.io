As you're probably aware, because all the [major](http://www.dabcc.com/article.aspx?id=7807) [blogs](http://www.thomaskoetzing.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=278&Itemid=254) have [covered](http://www.brianmadden.com/blog/BrianMadden/Major-news-items-from-Citrix-Synergy) it already, Citrix has purchased [sepagoProfile](http://www.sepago.com/e/news.html) from [sepago](http://www.sepago.com/e) with an agreement for sepago to continue development over the next 18 months. The product will become [Citrix User Profile Manager](http://www.citrix.com/site/jumpPage.asp?pageID=1453077).

I'm a fan of sepagoProfile because it's very simple and Group Policy based, which is a much better approach than one of the other major user profile management solutions that I've been working with in the past year. Teaming this with Group Policy Preferences gives you almost everything you'll need to manage the user workspace.

If you haven't seen sepagoProfile yet, I recommend downloading a copy from [My Citrix](https://www.citrix.com/userprofilemanager/previewdownload) and giving it a spin.
