Here&#8217;s a few articles that I&#8217;ve been reading recently and I thought it might be worthwhile sharing them:

Kevin Reeuwijk has an article on integrating App-V 4.5 with SCCM 2007 R2, but shows us how to get the best of both worlds - [How to integrate App-V with SCCM without losing the features you care about](http://www.buit.org/2009/02/13/how-to-integrate-app-v-with-sccm-without-losing-the-features-you-care-about/).

Mark Wilson takes aim at those who didn&#8217;t patch and were hit by Conficker (hopefully that wasn&#8217;t you) - [It’s time to take patch management seriously](http://www.markwilson.co.uk/blog/2009/01/its-time-to-take-patch-management-seriously.htm). However, I&#8217;m certain history will repeat itself in a few years.

One of my favourite sites, Ars Technica, is always able to take a level-headed approach when others stoop to senstionalism. This first article, [Paradigms lost: The Windows 7 Taskbar versus the OS X Dock](http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2009/01/dock-and-windows-7-taskbar.ars), shoots the Microsoft copies Apple argument in the foot. Whilst this article, [Oh, the humanity: Windows 7&#8217;s draconian DRM?](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/02/oh-the-humanity-windows-7s-draconian-drm.ars), shows why Slashdot is a waste of time.

Were I German, I would want to be working for [sepago](http://www.sepago.com).  These two articles are great - [Mandatory Profiles - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly](http://blogs.sepago.de/helge/2009/02/17/mandatory-profiles-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) and [Preserving Windows Explorer Folder Views in Roaming Profiles](http://blogs.sepago.de/nicholas/2009/02/17/preserving-windows-explorer-folder-views-in-roaming-profiles/).

And finally there&#8217;s this article by Mr. LUA - Aaron Magosis:  [FAQ: Why can’t I bypass the UAC prompt?](http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2007/06/29/faq-why-can-t-i-bypass-the-uac-prompt.aspx).
