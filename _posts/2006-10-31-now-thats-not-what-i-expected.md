I've been checking out the excellent [UltraMon](http://www.ultramon.com/) on Windows Vista, which provides some cool hacks for multiple displays under Windows. One of the excellent hacks is the ability to assign a hotkey that moves an application between screens - when you hit the hotkey the application or window appears on the next screen, very handy. However, this appears to work on the Start Menu too. I'm not sure if this happens on Windows XP but here's what you get with the Start Menu open and then hit the hotkey:

![Start menu]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2007/06/1000_14_167_startmenu1.jpg")

When you hit the hotkey again you get this:

![Start menu]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2007/06/1000_14_168_startmenu2.jpg)

As you can see the user tile stays where it is and if you keep hitting your hotkey the start menu moves back and forth between these two locations. It must be a feature ;).
