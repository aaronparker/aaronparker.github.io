The Short NAP is a quick list of Microsoft Network Access Protection and Server/Domain Isolation related links from around the web. Here are the links for Thursday the 10<sup>th</sup> of January 2008:

  * Jeff Sigman spent [Christmas day](http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Network_Access_Protection_Wiki)! creating [a wiki for Network Access Protection](http://networkap.wikia.com/). I think a better place for wiki would be on TechNet Edge..
  * Microsoft have a new page on TechNet, [Improving Network Compliance with Windows Server 2008 Network Access Protection](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/learning/networkcompliance.mspx), that brings together the various resources available to you for learning about Network Access Protection.
  * An [update is available for Windows Vista](http://support.microsoft.com/KB/943129) if you have implemented NAP with IPsec enforcement and are experiencing connectivity issues after running `GPUPDATE /FORCE`.
  * IT's Showtime has posted a [video on network security including details of IPsec implementation](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/technet/itsshowtime/sessionh.aspx?videoid=473) by John Craddock and Sally Storey from [Kimberry Associates](http://www.kimberry.co.uk).
  * Steve Lamb has details on [interoperability with IPsec on RedHat Linux and Windows Vista](http://blogs.technet.com/steve_lamb/archive/2007/12/28/how-to-implement-ipsec-between-linux-and-windows-vista-why-use-ipsec-network-security.aspx) from testing performed by [Port 25](http://port25.technet.com).
  * Dark Reading [discusses IPsec adoption for server and domain isolation](http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=141929), interoperability with Linux and NAP.
  * Dennis Chung answers the question: [Does IPSec make IPS/NDS redundant?](http://windowsmvp.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!80195647FE07388F!547.entry) Essentially - No, unless you are using encryption.
  * Greg Shields [highlights a new a whitepaper available that compares 5 NAC products](http://www.realtime-windowsserver.com/market_news_trends/2007/12/what_other_options_to_microsof.htm). Unfortunately registration is required to read the paper.
  * TechRepublic continues their articles on NAP with [Take a NAP to secure your network](http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/2415-1035_11-179190.html). This is a great introduction article that also discusses Cisco's NAC and [PacketFence](http://www.packetfence.org/).
