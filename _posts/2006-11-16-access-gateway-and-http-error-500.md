We are testing a private hotfix from Citrix that addresses a HTTP Error 500 on the Access Gateway Advanced Edition 4.2. You may have seen this error in your Access Gateway implementations where access to a Logon Point on the Access Gateway produces the error and a reboot of the appliance temporarily fixes the issue. The hotfix brings the Access Gateway version to **Access Gateway 4.2.3 Build 81.31; Build Date: 2006-11-03**. I'm unsure if this hotfix is generally available, but if you are experiencing the issue give the good looking guys at Citrix Support a call to obtain a copy of the fix, or wait until a general hotfix is available from the Citrix support web site.
