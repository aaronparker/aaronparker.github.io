Here's a quick list of interesting NAP and Domain/Server Isolation related links for November:

  * [Ian Hameroff: Come Together, Right Now: IPsec and VPN Co-Existence](http://blogs.technet.com/ianhamer/archive/2006/11/10/come-together-right-now-ipsec-and-vpn-co-existence.aspx)
  * [What is ForeFront Client Security and how will it protect my enterprise from malware?](http://blogs.technet.com/steve_lamb/archive/2006/11/13/what-is-forefront-client-security-and-how-will-it-protect-my-enterprise-from-malware.aspx) (This looks like a very compelling product and NAP integration makes it look even better)
  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/ipsec/simplepolicy.mspx" title="Simplifying IPsec Policy with the Simple Policy Update">Simplifying IPsec Policy with the Simple Policy Update</a> (This has been around for a while, but a requirement for Domain/Server Isolation with IPSec simplification)
  * [Quarterly TechNet Briefing: NAP Overview Slides](http://wic245d.server-web.com/itpro/nap_update.ppt) (.PPT, [thanks Jeff](http://blogs.technet.com/jeffa36/archive/2006/11/10/quarterly-technet-briefings-slides-available.aspx))
