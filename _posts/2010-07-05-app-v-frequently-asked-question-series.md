<img style="margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; display: inline;" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/AppVFAQLogo.png" alt="" align="left" />Starting tomorrow, I have a new blog post series &#8211; [Microsoft App-V FAQs](http://stealthpuppy.com/tag/appvfaq). There has been a [SoftGrid FAQ](http://blogs.technet.com/b/dhitchen/) blog on Microsoft TechNet in the past, but it’s now very  out of date. You can find official FAQs such as the [App-V 4.6 on TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/appvirtualization/cc664494.aspx) and an [App-V 4.5 SP2 FAQ document](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/1/D/41D55415-4879-4F7D-B845-EA24D9356D10/App-V%204.5%20SP2%20FAQ.docx), but these are a bit limited in scope.

If you spend any time on the [TechNet App-V forums](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-GB/category/appvirtualization) or on [AppVirtGuru.com](http://www.appvirtguru.com/) you’ll notice that many questions have often been asked previously or are answered by existing documentation. I hope to make this series is an attempt at answering many of those common questions.

Keep an eye out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for new FAQs. (Fingers crossed, I’ve got about 12 weeks worth of content so far, let’s see how this goes<img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/wlEmoticonwinkingsmile.png" alt="Winking smile" /> ).
