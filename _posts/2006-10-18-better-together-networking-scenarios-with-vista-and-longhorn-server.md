[Ian Hameroff](http://blogs.technet.com/ianhamer) has put together a great [webcast on the networking features](https://www115.livemeeting.com/cc/msevents/view?id=815&role=attend&pw=JEGHSDHS) of Windows Vista and Longhorn Server, and as you might expect from the title, how they work when the Longhorn client and server versions are teamed together. The webcast includes an overview of Network Access Protection and [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/cableguy/cg0106.mspx) as well as Server and Domain Isolation and IPSec. The whole webcast is worth watching, however if you&#8217;re only interested in NAP and the Windows Firewall skip to about the 19 minute mark.
