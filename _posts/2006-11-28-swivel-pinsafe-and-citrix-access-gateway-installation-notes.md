The good guys over at [Swivel](http://www.swivelsecure.com/) have let me post a document that Graham Field (from Swivel) has created for integrating Swivel PINsafe into Access Gateway Advanced Edition 4.5. The document covers everything you&#8217;ll need to get PINsafe authentication working with Advanced Access Control, including setting up Turing or Single Channel authentication (use to stop bots not humans). You get a copy of the document in [Word format here](http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/PINsafeCAGIntegration.doc) and the LOGIN.ASCX with the code for setting up the [Turing authentication here](http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/PINsafeLoginASX.zip).
