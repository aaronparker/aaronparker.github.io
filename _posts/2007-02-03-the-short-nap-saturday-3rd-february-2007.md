Lot's of NAP in the news over the past week or two, now if only I had the time and resources at the moment to do some more NAP testing.

  * [Microsoft Network Access Protection Achieves 100-Partner Milestone](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/feb07/02-01MSNAP100PR.mspx)  
    The number partners supporting NAP hits 100, but anyone would be foolish to be left behind I think.
  * Chat Transcript: [EAPHost in Windows Vista and Longhorn (January 18, 2006)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/chats/trans/windowsnet/07_0118_tn_eaphost.mspx)  
    In-depth EAP chat, not for the feint of heart
  * [Windows Security Health Agent (WSHA) and Windows Security Health Validator (WSHV)](http://blogs.technet.com/nap/archive/2007/01/30/windows-security-health-agent-wsha-and-windows-security-health-validator-wshv.aspx)  
    Quick overview of the health agents and vaildators available in Vista/Longhorn and Windows XP
  * [Windows XP NAP client complete?](http://blogs.technet.com/nap/archive/2007/01/24/nap-the-world-rsa-2007.aspx)  
    Jeff Sigman's not so subtle hint at the XP NAP client demo as RSA 2007
  * [NAP Web Chats coming your way!](http://blogs.technet.com/nap/archive/2007/01/23/nap-web-chats-coming-your-way.aspx)  
    The 'Using Microsoft's RADIUS server to secure your Network' chat has been and gone (hopefully a transcript soon) the 'Network Access Protection (NAP) System Health Agent/Validator (SHA/SHV) SDK' is still to come.
