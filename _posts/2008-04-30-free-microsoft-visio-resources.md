I've seen some Visio resources popup around the place recently and though that these were worth sharing.

First up, check out the [Visio Toolbox](http://visiotoolbox.com) site where you [learn](http://visiotoolbox.com/traininglanding.aspx) how to use Visio, download some [connectors](http://visiotoolbox.com/downloads.aspx?resourceid=2) and check out some [whitepapers](http://visiotoolbox.com/downloads.aspx?resourceid=2).&#160; A free version of [SolarWinds LANsurveyor Express](http://www.solarwinds.com/visio_promo/index.aspx?CMP=LEC-Visio-Toolbox-HP-LSE-DL) (available until June 30) is also available:
