Another excellent document for protecting Exchange with ISA Server

[Application Layer Firewall protection for Exchange Server 2003 with ISA Server 2004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/isa/2004/plan/firewall-exchange2003.mspx)

And reinforcingÂ aÂ [post from last month](http://blogs.virtualserver.tv/blogs/parky/archive/2005/08/17/42.aspx):

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p>
    &#8220;We do not recommend placing an Exchange front-end server in a perimeter network because it is not designed to be a security context, and it requires extensive connectivity to Active Directory and the Exchange back-end servers.&#8221;
