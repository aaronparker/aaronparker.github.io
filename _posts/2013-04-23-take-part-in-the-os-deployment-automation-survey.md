At [Citrix Synergy in Anaheim](http://www.citrixsynergy.com/losangeles/index.html) next month, I&#8217;ll have the opportunity to present a [Geek Speak Live](http://www.citrixsynergy.com/losangeles/sessions-labs/breakout-sessions.html?track=Geek+Speak+Live!) session &#8211; [Hands Off My Gold Image!](https://citrix.g2planet.com/synergylosangeles2013/public_session_view.php?agenda_session_id=274&conference=synergy) If you aren&#8217;t automating the creation of your gold images, there&#8217;s lots to learn in this session. Even if you are automating your gold images, perhaps there&#8217;s something new that I can still share with you. In this session, which will be demo heavy, I&#8217;ll show you some ways that you can deliver build automation with toolsets provided by Microsoft and Citrix.

I&#8217;m big on automation, especially when it comes to gold images. If you&#8217;re building images via a manual process, I contend that you cannot deliver the quality and consistency that is provided through an automated process. PVS, MCS/linked clones etc. are not a replacement for automation either. An open and repeatable build process improves the user experience and reduces the cost of support, because Windows is no longer a black box. Instead the entire process from start to finish, can be viewed, interrogated and understood by everyone.

In my [role](https://citrix.g2planet.com/synergylosangeles2013/public_speaker_view.php?speaker_id=361&conference=synergy) at [Kelway](http://www.kelway.co.uk), I get to talk many customers about how to better deliver and manage their physical and virtual desktop environments, but it&#8217;s still surprising to me that often automation is an afterthought.

So for this talk, I wanted to provide more than just anecdotal evidence, I&#8217;d like to back up my approach with some real data. That&#8217;s where I need 60 seconds of your time to contribute to a survey. Here&#8217;s a 5 question, anonymous survey designed to gather some details on OS automation in hosted desktop environments:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  [polldaddy survey=&#8221;5E367B86C0AE2769&#8243; type=&#8221;button&#8221; title=&#8221;Take the OS Automation survey&#8221; style=&#8221;rounded&#8221; text_color=&#8221;FFFFFF&#8221; back_color=&#8221;000000&#8243;]
</p>

This survey will be available until at least Synergy in May, where I&#8217;ll present the results during my talk &#8211; [Hands Off My Gold Image!](https://citrix.g2planet.com/synergylosangeles2013/public_session_view.php?agenda_session_id=274&conference=synergy)
