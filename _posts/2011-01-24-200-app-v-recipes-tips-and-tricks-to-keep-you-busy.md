With my post on virtualising the [App-V Management Console]({{site.baseurl}}/virtualisation/sequencing-the-app-v-management-console/) last week, this list has hit 200 links.

In this list you'll find completed recipes plus numerous other resources such as forum threads and knowledgebase articles that solve problems people have faced when virtualising their applications.

We'll continue to add links as we find them, so if you'd like to keep up to date, you can subscribe to the [App-V Recipes and Tips feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/appvrecipes) or you can view the complete list in my [App-V Recipe Delicious Bookmarks](http://www.delicious.com/aaronparker/AppVRecipe).

[Enjoy]({{site.baseurl}}/appvrecipes/).
