It&#8217;s been a while since an entrant in the [Hall of Shame](http://stealthpuppy.com/category/hall-of-shame), so today I&#8217;m pleased to bring you a bit of a chuckle courtesy of ACDSee Standard 5.0. It seems that the Tips dialog in this old version, doesn&#8217;t like it if you&#8217;ve installed the application to a non-default location (think sequencing in SoftGrid). Perhaps this dialog has a case of what my wife would call &#8220;Man eyes&#8221; (very similar to [inattentional blindness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness)).
