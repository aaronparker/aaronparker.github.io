It's been a while since an entrant in the [Hall of Shame]({{site.baseurl}}/category/hall-of-shame), so today I'm pleased to bring you a bit of a chuckle courtesy of ACDSee Standard 5.0. It seems that the Tips dialog in this old version, doesn't like it if you've installed the application to a non-default location (think sequencing in SoftGrid). Perhaps this dialog has a case of what my wife would call "Man eyes" - very similar to [inattentional blindness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness).
