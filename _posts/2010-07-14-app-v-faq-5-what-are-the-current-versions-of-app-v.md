For the full list of available versions and hotfixes for all App-V components see the spread sheet at the end of this post.

# App-V Client

The current App-V client versions are shown in the table below:

[table id=20 /]

# App-V Management Server and Streaming Server

The current version of the App-V Management Server and the App-V Streaming Server is **4.5.x**. This is true for both the App-V 4.5 and 4.6 client â€“ _there are no server components currently at version 4.6_.

# App-V Sequencer

The current App-V Sequencer versions are shown in the table below:

[table id=21 /]

# The Complete List

If you are looking for the complete list of App-V client, server and Sequencer versions since 4.5, I have taken a spread sheet [initially created by Justin Zarb](http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualworld/archive/2010/07/07/app-v-versions.aspx), and updated it with the latest releases. An embedded view the spread sheet, [hosted on SkyDrive](http://cid-74b5baa3414de283.office.live.com/browse.aspx/Public/App-V?uc=1), is below for easy viewing:
