Â If you're looking at deploying the updated [Access Management Console](https://www.citrix.com/English/SS/downloads/details.asp?dID=8218&downloadID=164650&pID=186#top) you might be interested in how to perform an unattended install. There are really two ways to do this:

  1. Use Windows Installer (MSIEXEC) to run each of the installer packages
  2. Run the CTXINSTALL setup application

Using the Windows Installer packages is fairly straight-forward, but you'l have to ensure you install the ASC_Framework.MSI package before installing any of the other packages.

The second and probably simplest method to perform an unattended install is to use the SILENT* switch on with the CTXINSTALL application:

[code]START /WAIT CTXINSTALL.EXE /SILENT[/code]

*No thanks to Citrix for this. A /? argument on their installers would be really nice..
