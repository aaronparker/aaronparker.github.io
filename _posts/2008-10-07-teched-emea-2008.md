<img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px" title="TechEd" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/teched.png" border="0" alt="TechEd" width="200" height="118" align="left" /> [TechEd EMEA 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/emea/teched2008/itpro/default.aspx) in sunny Barcelona is coming up pretty quick and [the schedule](http://emea.msteched.com/itpro/sessionpreferencesurvey.aspx) has been posted (you’ll have to be attending to see it). There’s plenty of excellent sessions to choose from and for me it's going to be lots of App-V and Windows Vista content.

The only downside is that on the Thursday (6th Nov) there are two App-V sessions that I would really like to attend but they’re on at the same time: _Microsoft Application Virtualization, Package and Data Management_ and _Microsoft Application Virtualization management and System Center Configuration Manager 2007 R2_. If the schedule isn’t changed, hopefully someone will take some details notes from the ConfigMgr session, because I’ll be attending the other.

I’m going to make an attempt to cover the sessions I’m attending and post some details over the week, so hopefully I can provide something useful around App-V and Windows Vista content.

So who’s going? If you are, feel free to drop me an e-mail if you’d like to catch up for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a beer</span> some sangría.
