The Short NAP is a (semi-regular) quick list of Microsoft Network Access Protection and Server/Domain Isolation related links from around the web. Here are the links for Monday the 17<sup>th</sup> of December 2007:

  * The [Cable Guy gives a great overview](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/12/CableGuy/default.aspx), yet in-depth look at Network Access Protection in Windows Server 2008. Via [Jeff](http://blogs.technet.com/nap/archive/2007/12/03/the-cable-guy-loves-nap.aspx).
  * Avenda releases [their NAP agent for Linux](http://www.avendasys.com/products/nap.shtml) in beta with support for RedHat based distributions Via [Jeff](http://blogs.technet.com/nap/archive/2007/12/03/hot-news-want-to-try-out-the-linux-nap-client.aspx).
  * TechNet Edge has a screencast of Network Access Protection [integration with TS Gateway](http://edge.technet.com/Media/Does-your-Terminal-Server-need-a-NAP/).
  * Here&#8217;s a great TechNet article: [Windows Server 2008 in an Organization&#8217;s Defense in Depth Strategy](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/columns/secmvp/sv1207.mspx) by [Jay Paloma](http://msforums.ph/blogs/jpaloma/). This covers the Network Policy Server of which NAP is a component.
  * Dave Northey [gets some great feedback](http://blogs.technet.com/daven/archive/2007/12/03/thoughts-from-the-field-on-windows-server-2008-nap.aspx) from a customer testing NAP in Ireland.
  * Premier Support customers have a [Security Health Check available](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9767cd2b-c089-403f-acb0-cb4a80218bfa&displaylang=en&lc=1033) to help them get their processes and policies in place. Enforcing those policies is what NAP is all about.
  * Ronald Beekelaar has created a [Server and Domain Isolation Demo](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=13a0ab69-2113-482e-a6d1-911aff9e9e2d&displaylang=en) for use with Virtual PC/Server. [Ian Hameroff has more details](http://blogs.technet.com/ianhamer/archive/2007/12/03/test-drive-server-and-domain-isolation.aspx) and a Windows Vista/2008 version is on the way.
  * TechRepublic has a number of new articles on NAP: [Introducing Network Access Protection for Windows](http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/2415-1035_11-177853.html), [Configuring Network Access Protection for Windows Server 2008](http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/2415-1035_11-178022.html), [Enterprise considerations for Microsoft Network Access Protection](http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/2415-1035_11-178604.html), [Wireless considerations and Network Access Protection resources](http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/2415-1035_11-178609.html) and [Learn how Windows Vista takes a NAP](http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/2415-1035_11-178575.html). Rick Vanover takes you through quite a good bit of information on NAP. The last paragraph of the 'Enterprise consideration&#8217; article is surprising given that the required information is actually well known:

> It is not clear what implementation configuration would be required for Windows XP clients since Service Pack 3 is not yet available; nor is it clear how a Windows XP MS-NAP client would be managed &#8212; if at all possible &#8212; from a Windows Server 2008 functionality level Active Directory domain.

  * Celestix announce their [Network Access Protection appliance](http://www.celestix.com/press/pressrelease.asp?SRC=pr11122007.htm) to be available not long after the release of Windows Server 2008. This should be an appealing solution, but I&#8217;m interested in how this integrates with existing Certificate Services implementations.
  * Techworld reports on the [current state of Network Access Control](http://www.techworld.com/security/features/index.cfm?featureid=3835) solutions â€“ are current solutions delivering on their promise? With broad support already, Microsoft&#8217;s NAP could help to improve the situation.

Amongst all this news, as you&#8217;re most likely aready aware, Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 Release Candidates are available which give the best indication yet of what Network Access Protection is capable of.
