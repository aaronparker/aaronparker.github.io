Jason Conger has released [Web Interface for Resource Manager 2.1](http://www.jasonconger.com/ShowPost.aspx?strID=f0d11211-b409-462b-83e7-db1c17020ce5). This couldn't be more timely for me as I'm in the middle of a Presentation Server 4.0 implementation using Oracle 10g to host the data store and Resource Manager databases. Here's what's new in this release:

  * Graphical Configuration Tool
  * Oracle Support
  * Multiple Language Support

This tool is some fantastic work from Jason, it makes life with Resource Manager that much simpler. If you have not seen WIRM before and you use Presentation Server Enterprise edition, I recommend checking this one out.
