Here&#8217;s an interesting video on the Channel 9 site about the architecture of Microsoft Application Virtualization:

> John Sheehan, Architect of Microsoft&#8217;s AppVirt (SoftGrid) technology, spends some time with me digging (deeply) into the architecture and engineering of the application virtualization technology he and team create. [A few months ago John joined us for a Going Deep on application virtualization](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/John-Sheehan-Inside-Application-Virtualization/) and you asked for more (and you asked for us to go deeper &#8211; John only scratchd the surface last time we spoke). Well, here you go, Niners. Deep AppVirt. This is whiteboard-heavy and John&#8217;s mic&#8217;d so the sound quality is exceptional.
