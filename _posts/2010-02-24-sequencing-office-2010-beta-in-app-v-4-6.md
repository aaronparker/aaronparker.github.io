A new&nbsp;knowledge-base&nbsp;article, released on the 22nd, is available from Microsoft for sequencing Office 2010 (32-bit and 64-bit) with App-V 4.6:

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980861" mce_href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980861">Prescriptive guidance for sequencing the Beta version of the 2010 Office system in Microsoft App-V</a>

It&#8217;s interesting to note that the article states that this is not the only way to sequence Office 2010. Does the Office team have something else up their sleeve?

> No formal product support is available from Microsoft for this beta product. For information about how to obtain support for a beta release, see the documentation that is included with the beta product files, or check the Web location where you downloaded the release.

> This article describes one method that you can use to successfully sequence the Beta version of the 2010 Microsoft Office system for use with Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.6. The method that is described in this article is not the only method that is available. You may have to change the information in the article as appropriate for your particular environment.
