My old favourite [Daemon Tools](http://www.daemon-tools.cc/home) just hasn't been working in Windows 7, so I've been on the look out for another tool for mounting ISOs. I haven't really liked other tools like CloneDrive or PowerISO, but I've come across [Psimo File Mount](http://www.pismotechnic.com/pfm/) (via [My Digital Life](http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/03/15/pismo-file-mounter-to-mount-zip-iso-compactiso-compact-file-set-and-private-folder-files-to-file-system-as-virtual-folder/), I think) which so far has been working a treat.

File Mount has [a pretty impressive feature set](http://www.pismotechnic.com/pfm/doc/), but its' simple approach to handling ISOs is what I'm really enjoying. There's pleny of options to suit (hopefully) everyone when mounting an image:

![mountoptions]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2009/03/mountoptions.png)

If you don't need to mount an ISO to a drive letter, File Mount will convert the ISO to a folder which you can then view directly in Explorer:

![windows7iso]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2009/03/windows7iso.png)

Works well for in-place upgrades to newer Windows 7 builds.. ðŸ˜‰
