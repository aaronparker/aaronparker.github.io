My old favourite [Daemon Tools](http://www.daemon-tools.cc/home) just hasn&#8217;t been working in Windows 7, so I&#8217;ve been on the look out for another tool for mounting ISOs. I haven&#8217;t really liked other tools like CloneDrive or PowerISO, but I&#8217;ve come across [Psimo File Mount](http://www.pismotechnic.com/pfm/) (via [My Digital Life](http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/03/15/pismo-file-mounter-to-mount-zip-iso-compactiso-compact-file-set-and-private-folder-files-to-file-system-as-virtual-folder/), I think) which so far has been working a treat.

File Mount has [a pretty impressive feature set](http://www.pismotechnic.com/pfm/doc/), but its&#8217; simple approach to handling ISOs is what I&#8217;m really enjoying. There&#8217;s pleny of options to suit (hopefully) everyone when mounting an image:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1056" title="mountoptions" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mountoptions.png" alt="mountoptions" width="423" height="449" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mountoptions.png 423w, https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mountoptions-282x300.png 282w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /> 

If you don&#8217;t need to mount an ISO to a drive letter, File Mount will convert the ISO to a folder which you can then view directly in Explorer:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1057" title="windows7iso" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/windows7iso.png" alt="windows7iso" width="590" height="194" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/windows7iso.png 590w, https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/windows7iso-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /> 

Works well for in-place upgrades to newer Windows 7 builds.. ðŸ˜‰
