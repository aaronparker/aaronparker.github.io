It's been a long time coming and the time is nearly here for the inaugural meeting of the [Melbourne Citrix User Group](https://www.mycugc.org/page/melbourne-dec6-2016?source=5). On the **6th of December 2016**, we'll be really proud to kick off an independent Citrix User Group at the Golden Gate Hotel, South Melbourne.

Our aim is to create an event that remains independent from Citrix, that meets quarterly and is by the users, for the users. We'd love to have your involvement, providing the community the chance shape future events. Your group leaders will all be there and keen to hear from you:
