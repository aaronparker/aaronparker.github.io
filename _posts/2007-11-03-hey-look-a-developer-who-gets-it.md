Well they came close, really close, but full marks goes to Axialis for first making the command line options for their installer and then making them nice and easy to see too. I got a nice surprise when installing the latest version of [Axialis IconWorkshop](http://www.axialis.com/iconworkshop/), which has a link to the command line options right on the setup wizard. Now if only the setup programme was based on Windows Installer I&#8217;d be even more impressed.

Here&#8217;s a couple of screenshots of what you see during installation::
