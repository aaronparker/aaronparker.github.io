I haven't used [Orca](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370557.aspx) to edit MSI files since I found [Camwood](http://www.camwood.com/) appEditor around November last year. Since then though, appEditor has become has become [InstEd](http://www.instedit.com/) and it's [even better](http://www.instedit.com/features2) than its' predecessor.

[<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="480" alt="InstEd Screenie" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/2008/07/insted-screenie-thumb.png]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2008/07/insted-screenie.png) 

This is a great way to edit MSI files and create transforms, being able to see the MSI with the Components and Features views lifts this tool far above [Orca](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F26B1AA4-741A-433A-9BE5-FA919850BDBF&displaylang=en). 

There's not much point for me to go through all of [the great things InstEd does](http://www.instedit.com/features), because it's completely free, so [grab yourself a copy](http://www.instedit.com/download) and take it for a spin.

You'll also find some great posts on editing MSIs and Transforms at the [InstEd blog](http://blog.instedit.com/) too.
