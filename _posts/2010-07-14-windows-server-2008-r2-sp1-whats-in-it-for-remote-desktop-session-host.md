Previous posts like this have shorter titles: [Windows Server 2008 SP2: What’s in it for Terminal Servers?](https://stealthpuppy.com/windows/windows-server-2008-sp2-whats-in-it-for-terminal-servers) and [Windows Server 2003 SP2: What’s in it for Terminal Servers?](https://stealthpuppy.com/windows/windows-server-2003-sp2-what%E2%80%99s-in-it-for-terminal-servers)

The document [Hotfixes and Security Updates included in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 Beta](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194725) has the complete list of what’s fixed in SP1. [RemoteFX](http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/brianmadden/archive/2010/07/13/microsoft-remotefx-is-now-available-via-public-beta.aspx) might steal the show, however I’m specifically interested in what fixes there are for Terminal Server or Remote Desktop Session Host as it’s now called.

The table below is filtered for just those fixes, each of which is available now if you can’t wait for SP1 due in H1 2011:

[table id=23 /]

If you can't wait for SP1, a list of recommended updates for RDS is available here: [Recommended Updates for the Remote Desktop Services (Terminal Services) in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2312539)

If you’re interested in the Group Policy fixes in SP1, [Alan has listed those here](http://www.grouppolicy.biz/2010/07/the-complete-list-of-group-policy-hotfixs-in-windows-72008-r2-service-pack-1/).
