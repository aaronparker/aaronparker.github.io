No doubt you've seen lots of news recently about the attempted crackdown on the release of the [HD-DVD encryption key](http://arstechnica.com/search.ars?Tag=aacs) (Google lists about [731000 sites listing the key](http://www.google.com/search?q=09-f9-11-02-9d-74-e3-5b-d8-41-56-c5-63-56-88-c0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) so far.

I've got nothing new to add to this myself, but it was timely that this week I watched a talk by [Cory Doctorow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow) gave to Microsoft Research a few years ago on why DRM is a bad thing. He also talks about these types of protection schemes whereby the user has both the protected content and the key to decrypt the content (i.e. what did the AACS think was going to happen?). If you are interested this talk you can check it out here:
