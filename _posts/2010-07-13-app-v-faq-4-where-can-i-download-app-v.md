## Is a trial version of App-V available?

Microsoft does not provide a trial version of App-V, there are a couple of ways that you can start testing App-V before deciding on whether it's the right product for your environment. The App-V for RDS software is freely available on the Microsoft Download Center (although make sure you are licensed before you use it in production). Alternatively Microsoft provides a set of labs that you can use to become familiar with App-V:
