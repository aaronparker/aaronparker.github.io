![MSPress]({{site.baseurl}}/media/2008/01/0063980v.jpg) has turned up from Amazon today. This is a hefty book - at 816 pages it weighs a ton but there's plenty of detail.

It's a bit early for me to give you an idea of what the book is like, but from the brief look I've had it's worth a place in your library if you'll be dealing with Windows 2008's networking features. The section dedicated to NAP takes up just under 1/2 of the book with some clear explanations of it's components.

Here's a list of the contents so you can see for yourself what's in this book:

> _Part I Addressing and Packet Flow Infrastructure_
>
>   * IPv4
>   * IPv6
>   * Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
>   * Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
>   * Policy-Based Quality of Service
>   * Scalable Networking
> 
> _Part II Name Resolution Infrastructure_
> 
>   * Domain Name System
>   * Windows Internet Name Service
> 
> _Part III Network Access Infrastructure_
> 
>   * Authentication Infrastructure
>   * IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks
>   * IEEE 802.1X-Authenticated Wired Networks
>   * Remote Access VPN Connections
>   * Site-to-Site VPN Connections
> 
> _Part IV Network Access Protection Infrastructure_
> 
>   * Network Access Protection Overview
>   * Preparing for Network Access Protection
>   * IPsec Enforcement
>   * 802.1X Enforcement
>   * VPN Enforcement
>   * DHCP Enforcement

What was a pleasant surprise is that you get a _complete_ PDF version on the included CD, as well as 2 more books in PDF format: [Understanding IPv6 2nd Edition]({{site.baseurl}}/wp-admin/Understanding%20IPv6%202nd%20Edition) (complete version too) and TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows. Not bad for Â£26.

Sadly for any Australian readers, you won't be getting anywhere near that price. These best I've found is [$89.95 AU from Booktopia](http://www.booktopia.com.au/windows-server-2008-networking-and-network-access-protection/prod9780735624221.html). That price difference doesn't sound fair to me.
