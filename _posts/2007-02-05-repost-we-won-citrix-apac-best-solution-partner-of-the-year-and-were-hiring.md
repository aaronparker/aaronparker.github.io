I briefly thought about posting this but I knew [Dugie would do a better job of it anyway](http://blogs.virtualserver.tv/blogs/dugie/archive/2007/02/06/w00t-we-won-citrix-apac-best-solution-partner-of-the-year-and-we-re-hiring.aspx) (thanks Dugie):

> Last week it was announced at the Citrix Summit in Orlando that we (as in Clariti) are the Best APAC Solution Partner of the year &#8211; how cool is that?!
> 
> Well Ok, I may be biased but I think its way cool. APAC covers Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Greater China, Singapore, India, PNG, Australia, and New Zealand. Close to 700 Citrix partners, and US$100M in sales &#8212; and we won!
> 
> We&#8217;re also hiring (actually we&#8217;re always looking for great people) for:
> 
>   * Pre-Sales, Technical Architects
>   * Team Leaders
>   * Technical Account Managers
>   * Level 1 Help Desk
>   * High End Senior Citrix Specialists
> 
> If any of these roles fulfil your secret burning desire to change the world &#8212; and you live or want to live in sunny Brisbane, send my Manager, <a href="mailto:recruitment@clariti.com.au" target="_blank">Matthew Chilcott</a> an e-mail for more information.
> 
> PS: Last year there was no iForum and hence no shiny award, be we also won &#8220;Trusted Advisor of the year&#8221; in 2005, and aiming to win it again in 2007 ðŸ™‚
> 
> PPS: If you want to know more about Clariti or our <a href="http://www.cudakitchen.com/catalog-product.php?p_ref=248" target="_blank">awesome coffee machine</a>, feel free to drop me an e-mail or give me a call.
