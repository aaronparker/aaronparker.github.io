The latest TechNet Magazine has an article by [Raymon Chen](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing) on the &#8220;Program Files&#8221; and &#8220;Documents and Settings&#8221; folders, including changes to the [profiles folder in Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/08/WindowsConfidential/). It gives some clarification to the changes in Vista and I thought that it applies to [my previous post](/blogs/parky/archive/2006/07/25/1262.aspx).

> &#8220;Another security change in Windows Vista is that the All Users profile has been moved out of the profiles directory and into the root of the drive (though a symbolic link has been left in the profiles directory for compatibility purposes).&#8221;
