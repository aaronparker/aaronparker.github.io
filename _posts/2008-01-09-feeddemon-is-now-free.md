Great news - the gold standard of RSS/Atom/Feed readers on Windows [is now free](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/01/free-demon-yes.html). I&#8217;ve been using [FeedDemon](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx) for two years now and I can&#8217;t praise it enough. The free love continues too, because [NewsGator Go!](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NewsGatorGo/Default.aspx) and [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx) are also free.

With FeedDemon, NewsGator Go! and NewsGator Online, I have my feeds synchronised between two laptops, my work desktop and my phone, plus web access available from anywhere. If you&#8217;ve been sitting on the fence or looking for a better reading experience, take FeedDemon for a spin.
