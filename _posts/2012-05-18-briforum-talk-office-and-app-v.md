If you're attending [BriForum London](http://briforum.com/Europe/index.html) next week, I have a couple of lightning round sessions on Thursday at 13:40:

* Should Office Be in the Base Image?
* The Definitive Guide to Deploying Microsoft Office with App-V

This is really a single topic, but with any luck the discussion should be good and I'll share my tips for successfully virtualising Office, if I haven't talked you out of it in the first part of the presentation.

If you're coming to BriForum London, drop by and say Hi.
