I've been speedlinking some interesting Network Access Protection links in the past (which you can find [here](http://www.stealthpuppy.com/blogs/travelling/archive/2007/03/02/Speedlinking-Network-Access-Protection-Mar-2007.aspx), [here](http://www.stealthpuppy.com/blogs/travelling/archive/2007/02/03/speedlinking-nap-updates.aspx), [here](http://www.stealthpuppy.com/blogs/travelling/archive/2007/01/23/speedlinking-network-access-protection.aspx) and [here](http://www.stealthpuppy.com/blogs/travelling/archive/2007/01/05/speedlinking-nap-documents.aspx)) and as speedlinking is so very 2006, I thought that I would rebrand these types of posts to 'The Short NAP'. So here's The Short NAP for Tuesday 20 March 2007.

    Jeff Sigman prays to the demo gods at the MVP summit but they weren't listening, so he fixes it himself, also setting up a NAP server in Longhorn beta 3 takes about 15 minutes after improvements in the server console.
