<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/2008/02/updateadobereader.png" alt="updateadobereader.png" />Adobe have recently released [an update for Adobe Reader](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2_allversions.html) and Acrobat 8, updating them to version 8.1.2, to address [a serious vulnerability](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa08-01.html) that is leading to infections of [Trojan.Zonebac](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-091612-5500-99) via malicious banner advertisements.

The Sunbelt Software blog has some more detail on the exploit here: [If you have Adobe Acrobat 7 or 8, make sure it's updated](http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/if-you-have-adobe-acrobat-7-or-8-makes.html), and here: [Adobe PDF exploit](http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/adobe-pdf-exploit.html).

If you're still using Adobe Reader 6 or 7, you should seriously consider updating now.
