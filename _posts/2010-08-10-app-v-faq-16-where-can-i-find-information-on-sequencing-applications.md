Before you even attempt your first sequence with App-V, I strongly recommend reading the [Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6 Sequencing Guide](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/7/8/F784A197-73BE-48FF-83DA-4102C05A6D44/App-46_Sequencing_Guide_Final.docx). This document lays the ground work for creating a successful sequencing environment and describes the best practices you should follow when sequencing. An older knowledgebase article exists, but it is still worth referencing: [Best practices to use for sequencing in Microsoft SoftGrid](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932137/).

The Microsoft TechNet forums is the main source of information for community lead recipes and answers to sequencing questions:

  * [App-V Sequencing Recipe Forum](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-gb/prescriptiveguidance/threads)
  * [App-V General Sequencing](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-gb/appvgeneralsequencing/threads)

Other locations include:

  * The [Sequencing](http://www.appvirtguru.com/viewforum.php?f=9&sid=f90286f14b4a830b4b7b4855d4f476c6) forum on [AppVirtGuru.com](http://www.appvirtguru.com)
  * [AppDeploy.com](http://www.appdeploy.com/packages/) is a great resource for creating silent installs, plus it also includes details for virtualising many of those applications

I have compiled a list of recipes, documents and forum links here at [stealthpuppy.com/AppVRecipes]({{site.baseurl}}/appvrecipes). This page draws from [a list of App-V recipe bookmarks from my Delicious account](http://delicious.com/aaronparker/AppVRecipe) which is updated regularly.
