We&#8217;re into the closing days of [the OS Deployment Automation Survey over at xenappblog.com](http://xenappblog.com/2015/take-part-in-the-os-deployment-automation-survey/) and we need you to help make this a success. So far we&#8217;ve had a great response with over 600 people taking part, but with a week still left there&#8217;s still plenty of time to get involved.

Here&#8217;s a quick peek into the results of one of the questions &#8211; what platforms are used to host your virtual desktop environment. It probably doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise that vSphere is ahead; however it&#8217;s very interesting to see the number of respondents running their environments on bare metal.

The survey will take less than 5 minutes of your time, so if you&#8217;ve not had a chance to take the survey, [head over now](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WG3CGZK) or help spread the word. After the survey closes, we&#8217;ll share the results and our thoughts.
