This is a about a week old (I've been away in Italy so I'm a bit behind), but Adobe have released Reader 8.1.1. Currently only available in English with quite a few languages still only receiving 8.0. You can download the [full installer here](http://ardownload.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/8.x/8.1.1/enu/AdbeRdr811_en_US.exe) and find [what's been updated here](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=3806). Good news is that [my deployment instructions and transform for 8.1](https://stealthpuppy.com/deployment/deploying-adobe-reader-81) are still valid for this version.
