Citrix have updated the Win32 [Presentation Server Client Package to version 9.230](http://www.citrix.com/English/SS/downloads/details.asp?dID=2755&downloadID=162299&pID=186). Here's what I can find new or fixed specific to this version:

  * Universal printer preferences are not saved and retained between user sessions;
  * If a computer is running Windows 98, the real printer properties are not inherited for new user accounts;
  * If more than 100 printers are configured on the client device, a printer goes offline when receiving a print job;
  * When the client starts an application in Program Neighborhood and is logging on using single sign-on and smart cards, the Connection Established, Negotiating Capabilities window does not disappear.
