This tickled my fancy too much so I had to post it: [Bomberman Evolved](http://www.joystiq.com/2007/01/26/todays-hottest-game-video-bomberman-evolved/)

> Students at the University of Aalborg in Copenhagen are mid-way through creating a virtual Bomberman game called Bomberman Evolved. As shown in today's GameTrailers video, a camera mounted in the ceiling tracks the movement of two colored hats, steering on-screen Bomberman characters based on the two players' positions in the room.



After checking out the action on the Nintendo Wii I'd love to give this a go, until then I'll have to make do with [Bomberman on the Xbox 360](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/03/30/saturn-bomberman-being-evautated-for-xbl-arcade/) (hopefully soon).
