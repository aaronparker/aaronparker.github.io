    <p><a href="http://www.citrixsynergy.com">Citrix Synergy 2015</a> is just next week, so for me that means several things - attending CTP meetings (from about 8:00 am to 9:00 pm each day) on the Sunday and Monday, presenting a Geek Speak Live session on Tuesday, helping to man the <a href="http://www.atlantiscomputing.com">Atlantis</a> booth on the solutions expo floor, taking part in Geek Speak on Wednesday evening, meet old and new friends and generally have some fun.</p>

<p>Here’s a just few things that I’m looking forward to getting involved in and seeing at Synergy this year.</p>

<h1 id="ive-got-99-problems-and-folder-redirection-is-every-one-of-them">I’ve Got 99 Problems and Folder Redirection is Every One of Them</h1>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3941" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeakLive.jpg" alt="GeakSpeakLive" width="640" height="83" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeakLive.jpg 640w, https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeakLive-150x19.jpg 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeakLive-300x39.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<p>Along with <a href="http://twitter.com/helgeklein">Helge Klein</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/shawnbass">Shawn Bass</a>, I’ll be presenting a Geek Speak Live session on folder redirection. We presented on the same topic at BriForum Boston and London last year, and this time at Synergy we’re taking another deep technical look at folder redirection.</p>

<p>Folder redirection is a feature in Windows that practically all enterprises work with - it brings great benefit for providing users with a consistent view of their data, but it’s a technology that’s tightly intertwined with home drives, user profiles and Offline Files. There are many components of the user environment that interact and often each is not considered as a part of the whole - that is, how does one component impact on the other? So folder redirection is an important technology for us to cover.</p>

<p>We’ll talk about the challenges of folder redirection, present the results of testing that we’ve been working on, provide some recommendations on working with folder redirection and a discussion on alternatives.</p>

<p>We’ll be presenting next Tuesday the 14th (the first day of Synergy) at 2:30pm. <a href="https://citrix.g2planet.com/synergyorlando2015/public_session_view.php?agenda_session_id=185">SYN502: I’ve got 99 problems, and folder redirection is every one of them</a>. Please join us, we’d love to see you there.</p>

<h1 id="geek-speak-tonight">Geek Speak Tonight</h1>

<p><img class=" wp-image-3940 size-full alignnone" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeak.jpg" alt="GeakSpeak" width="445" height="83" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeak.jpg 445w, https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeak-150x28.jpg 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GeakSpeak-300x56.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to Geek Speak Tonight this year - a core team of some of the CTPs have been working on what I am sure will be <a href="https://citrix.g2planet.com/synergyorlando2015/public_session_view.php?agenda_session_id=157">the best Synergy Geek Speak Tonight</a> yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Geek Speak Live! continues its long tradition as one of the most popular and lively tracks at Citrix Synergy. It’s a unique platform for technology experts to show off their knowledge and for audience members to participate in friendly but frank debates on a variety of technical issues. At Synergy 2015, independent techies, industry analysts and bloggers will facilitate discussions in an atmosphere that encourages plenty of give and take.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year the theme is IoT including lively discussions and demos. There’ll be beer and food, most surely some swearing and definitely some laughs. Be sure to be there as this type of session is really about the audience as much as it is the presenters.</p>

<h1 id="geekovation">GeekOvation</h1>

<p>There’s a very special part of Geek Speak Tonight this year - <a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2015/04/16/geekovation-award-at-synergy-geek-speak-tonight/">GeekOvation</a>. This is your opportunity to show off your geek credentials. I’m looking forward to seeing these presentations and seeing special, real world examples of what people in the Citrix community are sinking their teeth into.</p>

<h1 id="user-group-initiatives">User Group Initiatives</h1>

<p>Some new initiatives around Citrix user groups looks to be one of those “worst keep secrets”, but I won’t share details, however this is something worth looking forward to and getting involved in. Full details will be announced by Citrix on Tuesday.</p>
