    <p><img align="left" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/exchange.png" />I’ve upgraded our internal Exchange organisation over the last week and I’ve got to say Exchange 2007 is a completely different ball game. Now for seasoned Exchange architects and administrators a lot of the Exchange 2007 upgrade process is probably not new, but for those of us who don’t look after Exchange full time it’s a steep learning curve. The biggest challenges for me have been around the new Exchange Management Shell. I think the implementation of PowerShell as the basis for all Exchange management is a good thing â€“ there’s nothing like being able to paste the exact command line into your change log. However there’s been a couple of issue that I’ve got with Exchange 2007:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The lack of detailed command line examples; and</li>
  <li>The stuff that’s been removed from the GUI since Exchange 2003.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an example. After upgrading to Exchange Server 2007, you need to upgrade the e-mail address policies. Now <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2007/01/11/432158.aspx">upgrading the Default Policy</a>, this is straight-forward, this is done with the following command:</p>

<p class="console">
  Set-EmailAddressPolicy &#8220;Default Policy&#8221; â€“IncludedRecipients AllRecipients
</p>

<p>Note that command doesn’t actually upgrade the policy, it recreates it. Why there isn’t and upgrade option I don’t know. So what happens when you want to “upgrade” a custom e-mail policy? Well you can use the wizard to create a new policy, but what do you do when you need to create a policy that uses a custom attribute (i.e. and LDAP query). In Exchange 2003 there was a nice GUI that you could use to construct the LDAP query:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/1000.14.1298.ExchangeRecipients.png" /></p>

<p>Now in Exchange 2007 there is no query builder, instead you get just this:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/1000.14.1299.Exchange2007CustomAttribute.png" /></p>

<p>Then check out the documentation on the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124517.aspx">Set-EmailAddressPolicy</a> command. There’s actually no detail there about what a custom attribute is let alone a link to how to create one. How’s that for a kick in the teeth?</p>

<p>So it looks like I’ll be learning about it more about LDAP queries (or maybe just keeping an Exchange 2003 server around in VM instead). After a bit of digging I’ve found a few links about LDAP queries, but let’s home Microsoft have something better in store for Exchange 2007 SP1.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa996205.aspx">LDAP Query Basics</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEV/How+to+write+a+LDAP+search+filter">How to write a LDAP search filter</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ldapadministrator.com/info.htm">Softerra LDAP Administrator 3.4</a> (This has some LDAP query functionality but I’ve only test the free version which doesn’t have this functionality)</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though I’m disappointed in the lack of clear documentation I am looking forward to being able to completely manage Exchange from the command line because deep down, I’m a command line kinda guy.</p>
