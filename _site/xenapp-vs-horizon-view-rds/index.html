    <p>Is VMware Horizon View 6 RDS a viable replacement or competitor to Citrix XenApp? A competitor, most certainly. View RDS as a replacement for XenApp deserves further investigation and I recommend no assumptions be made as to the suitability of View RDS, especially if you are a current Citrix customer, or a VMware partner.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting plays that VMware has with Horizon 6, is the ability to present resources through Horizon Workspace from Citrix XenApp. My initial knee jerk reaction was “why would you want to move from XenApp/XenDesktop to View?”, but it’s ultimately an excellent salvo in the fight to win customers away from Citrix.</p>

<p>This feature enables XenApp customers to implement View into existing environments and provide users with access to resources from XenApp and View from a single workspace. The aim is to create an on-ramp for the entire Horizon suite and ultimately a migration away from XenApp and/or XenDesktop.</p>

<p>Horizon View 6 RDS is really a first entry (or v2 depending on how you look at it) into published applications for VMware, so surely it can’t win in a head-to-head fight against XenApp? If you compare the two products in detail, what features of XenApp could you just not do without, or what features of View RDS would not be good enough?</p>

<p>I’ve put together a table in this article to compare features of XenApp and Horizon View RDS. This is not intended to be as feature complete or provide as much detail as the <a href="http://pqr.com/vdi-smackdown">VDI Smackdown</a>, instead I wanted to look at a handful of I what I see as the most important features and provide a quick a dirty reference.</p>

<p>There are a few things to keep in mind while reading this - a tick/star against a feature does not necessarily indicate that feature is directly comparable. Due to differences in approach and architecture, it’s very difficult to draw direct comparisons against some features.</p>

<p>I’ve added the VDI components of XenDesktop and View to provide reference.  The heading in the table “XenDesktop VDI” refers to the VDI features of XenDesktop, not the XenDesktop VDI edition. Any XenApp version between 6.5 and 7.6 should be applicable to this comparison.</p>

<p>This comparison is intended as a starting point for looking at both solutions. Your mileage will vary and I encourage performing your own due diligence. VMware has already improved View RDS with printing functionality within months of the original 6.0 release.</p>

<h1 id="feature-comparison">Feature Comparison</h1>

<p>[table id=34 /]</p>

<p>Here’s a set of additional XenApp and XenDesktop features that I’ll move into the table as time permits. In the meantime some of them are significant features that can’t be taken for granted.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Session Pre-launch - improve the perceived time to launch remote applications</li>
  <li>Session Linger - keep a remote session open for a period of time after closing all remote applications</li>
  <li>Anonymous Logon - allow access to remote applications without requiring authentication</li>
  <li>Advanced Policy Control and SmartAccess - Citrix has provided a flexible access control and policy solution within XenApp and XenDesktop, especially in conjunction with NetScaler</li>
  <li>User shadowing - remote controlling user sessions for support purposes</li>
  <li>Hypervisor-based read cache (IntelliCache, CSV Cache, CBRC) - how do these features fit into your storage requirements?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve made every effort to ensure this comparison is accurate at the time of posting; however this is subject to change and I’ll update as new information comes to light.</p>

<p>So, is Horizon View RDS ready to go head-to-head with XenApp? I have my own view, tempered by many years of working with Citrix products, but it’s great to see VMware taking a seat at the application delivering table. Whether Horizon View RDS wins out over XenApp, will of course depend on your own business and technical requirements.</p>
