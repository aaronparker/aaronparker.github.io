<p>I’ve seen some dumb software in my travels and <a href="http://www.mercury.com/us/products/quality-center/">Mercury Quality Center</a> is no exception; however this one has got me scratching my head.</p>

<p>Mercury Quality Center “provides a web-based system for <em>automated</em> software quality testing and management”. It uses a browser front-end with ActiveX controls connecting to a back-end process (I really don’t know much about the back-end). Now, as you would expect from the product description, Mercury Quality Center should be a nice quality package from end to end. In my view this would include a scriptable client installation package. Scripting any client software installation is important because it should be a consistent repeatable process.</p>

<p>Except that’s where they strike out. The incredibly dumb thing about this is the client software is packaged up in an <em>InstallShield</em> package which is only used to unpack some files and launch another custom installer. (See the screenshot). No silent install for you!</p>

<p>Who’s the dolt who created this? InstallShield’s not good enough to install your software? Surely quality software should extend to the installation experience as well? It makes you wonder.</p>
