<p>What’s the best <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/msappvirt45/default.mspx">new feature of Microsoft Application Virtualisation 4.5</a>? There’s plenty to pick from, but I’m digging the new Vista style icons:</p>

<p>SoftGrid has suffered from some clunky UI in the past, but thankfully 4.5 had made plenty of changes in the client, sequencer and server console which are most welcome. There are still some icons that haven’t been updated yet - here’s hoping they don’t get missed for the final release.</p>
