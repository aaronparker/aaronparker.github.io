<p>If you’ve ever downloaded a SCSI or RAID driver for an IBM server from the IBM web site, you’ll have probably come across the DOS based executable (yes it’s a 16bit executable) that unpacks the driver to a floppy disk for you. This thing makes you wade through 15 screens of license agreement and then you must agree to said license before it un-packs the driver to a floppy disk.</p>

<p>Now there are at least two problems with this: 1. We don’t really use floppy disks anymore and 2. On Windows Vista the executable just doesn’t run - Windows reports that the executable is invalid. I would love to talk to the person who puts these driver packages together, I bet he still wears, shorts and knee high socks to work (it’s a North Queensland thing..)</p>
