<p>At <a href="http://www.citrixsynergy.com/sanfrancisco/index.html">Citrix Synergy 2012</a>, I had the distinct pleasure of moderating a Geek Speak panel:  ”User Environment Management smackdown 2012” with <a href="http://twitter.com/shawnbass">Shawn Bass</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/helgeklein">Helge Klein</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/harrylabana">Harry Labana</a> from AppSense, <a href="http://twitter.com/bobtopus">Bob Janssen</a> from RES Software and <a href="http://twitter.com/mlarkin2012">Mike Larkin</a> from Citrix on the state of User Environment Management.</p>
