<p>A little more than just Internet Explorer 8 is removable in Windows 7 build 7048. This build allow you to remove Internet Explorer 8, Windows DVD Maker, Windows Media Center, Windows Media Player (no more N editions, I presume) and even Windows Search:</p>

<p>Given that Windows 7 Enterprise edition will be a superset of Home and Professional, being able to remove these components will be especially welcome for organisations deploying Enterprise edition .</p>

<p>AeroXperience has more on <a href="http://www.aeroxp.org/2009/03/ie8-functionally-removable/">removing Internet Explorer 8</a> which apparently only removes the IEXPLORE executable; however completely removing Internet Explorer would break compatibility with many applications, so I think calls for being able to remove all traces of IE are just un-realistic.</p>
