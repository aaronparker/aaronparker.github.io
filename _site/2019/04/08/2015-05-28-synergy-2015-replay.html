<p>As a part of the Geek Speak Live track at Synergy 2015, this was the first time that these sessions have been recorded. Previous to this year, no recordings were made available.</p>

<p>Going forward all of the Geek Speak sessions will be made available the new <a href="https://www.mycugc.org/p/do/sd/sid=25">Citrix User Group Community</a> (CUGC) site, so if you didn’t get to Synergy or unable to attend one of the Geek Speak sessions while you where there, <a href="https://www.mycugc.org/p/do/si/topic=18">you can catch up with all of them</a> over at the new community site.</p>

<p>To watch these you’ll need to sign up for the CUGC site, so you can take full advantage of the additional great content there and contribute to the wider Citrix community.</p>
