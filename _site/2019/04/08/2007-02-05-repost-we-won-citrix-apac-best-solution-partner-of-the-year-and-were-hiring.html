<p>I briefly thought about posting this but I knew <a href="http://blogs.virtualserver.tv/blogs/dugie/archive/2007/02/06/w00t-we-won-citrix-apac-best-solution-partner-of-the-year-and-we-re-hiring.aspx">Dugie would do a better job of it anyway</a> (thanks Dugie):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week it was announced at the Citrix Summit in Orlando that we (as in Clariti) are the Best APAC Solution Partner of the year - how cool is that?!</p>

  <p>Well Ok, I may be biased but I think its way cool. APAC covers Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Greater China, Singapore, India, PNG, Australia, and New Zealand. Close to 700 Citrix partners, and US$100M in sales ‚Äî and we won!</p>

  <p>We‚Äôre also hiring (actually we‚Äôre always looking for great people) for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pre-Sales, Technical Architects</li>
    <li>Team Leaders</li>
    <li>Technical Account Managers</li>
    <li>Level 1 Help Desk</li>
    <li>High End Senior Citrix Specialists</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If any of these roles fulfil your secret burning desire to change the world ‚Äî and you live or want to live in sunny Brisbane, send my Manager, <a href="mailto:recruitment@clariti.com.au" target="_blank">Matthew Chilcott</a> an e-mail for more information.</p>

  <p>PS: Last year there was no iForum and hence no shiny award, be we also won ‚ÄúTrusted Advisor of the year‚Äù in 2005, and aiming to win it again in 2007 üôÇ</p>

  <p>PPS: If you want to know more about Clariti or our <a href="http://www.cudakitchen.com/catalog-product.php?p_ref=248" target="_blank">awesome coffee machine</a>, feel free to drop me an e-mail or give me a call.</p>
