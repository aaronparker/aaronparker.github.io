    <p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2432" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="User001" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2011/10/User001.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" />Surely one of the main goals of any good desktop delivery project is to remove the user’s reliance on any single device?</p>

<p>To achieve that goal, we need to ensure that the user’s environment is available across any device. Whether the desktop is a physical PC, Remote Desktop server or running on a virtual machine in the data centre, providing the user with a consistent view of their applications allows them to be productive as soon as they logon.</p>

<p>Once we achieve device independence, users should rightly expect that their data and preferences will be available where ever they logon. At least, that’s what I would expect - I don’t care too much how I access an application, I’d like some consistency when I do access them. I’d like my favourites to follow me (<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=185277">Google got this right with Chrome</a>), I’d like my application settings to follow me, and of course my data as well.</p>

<p>How do we do this in a corporate environment today, with multiple operating systems and often multiple versions of an application? I can bet you aren’t achieving that with standard Roaming Profiles.</p>

<p>I’ve recently finished working on a project consisting of migrating to Windows 7 which also includes delivering desktops and applications using Citrix XenDesktop and XenApp. A key component of the migration was to provide users with some consistency across those desktops.</p>

<p>That’s not as simple as task as it may sound. How do you migrate user settings and preferences from the previous operating system and roam settings between Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (and with any luck, back again)?</p>

<p>Another barrier, and a surprising one to me, is that (depending on the size of the organisation) all architecture and engineering teams need to be on board with the roaming train. Having dealt with a team that was responsible for some of the core applications, who didn’t understand roaming, clear direction on the approach to the user environment is critical.</p>

<p>So my goal has been is this - provide the user with a single set of preferences across all operating systems. Even moving those preferences to down level versions of Windows if the project demands it. There will always be a certain subset of preferences that can’t be moved across Windows versions; however for the most part this is achievable.</p>

<p>I asserted this during my sessions at BriForum this year, in London and Chicago, <a href="http://briforum.com/US/sessions.html#userenvironment">User Environment Smack Down</a> - a single profile per user provides the best user experience.</p>

<p>However what if you don’t want that? Perhaps it’s a valid approach for a user to have completely separate profiles per machine. So I thought that a completely non-scientific poll might be an interesting way to find out your thoughts. Have you say by voting in the poll embedded below:</p>
