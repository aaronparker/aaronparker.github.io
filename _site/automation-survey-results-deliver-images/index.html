    <p>In the previous article, we covered <a href="http://xenappblog.com/2015/os-automation-survey-results-automation-solutions/">which automation solutions are in use to create</a> (and manage) master images. In this article we‚Äôll cover what tools or technologies are used to deliver an image to an end-point (that being a virtual machine or a physical device).</p>

<p>This is an important distinction ‚Äì often the solution for delivering the master image is relied upon for ‚Äúimage management‚Äù; however these solutions¬†aren‚Äôt typically capable of creating a framework for repeatable, consistent image creation. Solutions available for VDI (and RDS) for image delivery might differ depending on the product and some of those¬†include image versioning, but they do not enable complete recreation of an image from scratch without some form of automation.</p>

<p>Based on 524 responses to this question, we are able to see the following usage:</p>

<figure id="attachment_4205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4205" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-large wp-image-4205" src="http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WhatIsUsedToDeliverImage-1024x554.png" alt="What is used to deliver a standardised image to VMs or end-points." width="1024" height="554" srcset="http://192.168.0.89/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WhatIsUsedToDeliverImage-1024x554.png 1024w, http://192.168.0.89/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WhatIsUsedToDeliverImage-150x81.png 150w, http://192.168.0.89/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WhatIsUsedToDeliverImage-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />](http://stealthpuppy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WhatIsUsedToDeliverImage.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-4205" class="wp-caption-text">What is used to deliver a standardised image to VMs or end-points.</figcaption></figure>

<p>This result is similar to <a href="http://stealthpuppy.com/automation-survey-results-vdi-platforms/">the overall usage of VDI solutions</a> ‚Äì Citrix PVS and MCS usage is¬†higher than other solutions because the amount of XenDesktop and XenApp deployments is far higher than competing products.¬†Based on this usage, we can make a reasonable assumption that the majority of Citrix-based deployments are non-persistent; however ‚Äúpersistent desktops‚Äù based on MCS is common, so the numbers won‚Äôt be completely reflective of this chart.</p>

<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>

<p>Due to the manner in which we‚Äôve asked this particular question, I‚Äôm unable to correlate delivery solutions against some of the other useful¬†data, so we can draw some limited conclusions at this time. In the next article where we discuss patching schedules, it will be interested to link to delivery solutions.</p>

<p>One thing that did surprise me, is that I was unable to find any responder using Citrix PVS and a completely manual build process for their images. I‚Äôm not sure whether this is reflective of real world deployments or a result of how we asked the questions (I think the latter), but based on real world experience, I find this hard to believe. Perhaps several years of <a href="http://stealthpuppy.com/hands-off-my-gold-image-a-recap-from-citrix-synergy-2013/">encouraging people to automation their builds</a> is paying off. üòâ</p>

<p>Looking at those using PVS, each respondent has selected a custom scripted solution, typically in-conjunction with others tools such as MDT. 51 respondents are using a custom scripted solution for their master images with PVS only. For MCS this was 24 using a custom scripted solution only.</p>

<p>133 respondents use both PVS and MCS in their environments. Again, because we have respondents who are consultants delivering multiple environments there is cross-over here, but it is interesting nonetheless to see multiple Citrix delivery options used.</p>

<p>What about physical hardware? 6% of respondents use no virtualization at all in their SBC/VDI environments.</p>

<h1 id="next-up">Next Up</h1>

<p>In the next article, we‚Äôll take a look at how often people are <a href="http://stealthpuppy.com/automation-survey-results-update-images/">patching their master images</a>.</p>
