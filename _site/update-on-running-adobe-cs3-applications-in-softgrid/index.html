    <p>I have previously detailed some efforts on sequencing some of the Adobe CS3 applications (<a href="/virtualisation/sequencing-adobe-photoshop-cs3">Photoshop</a>, <a href="/virtualisation/sequencing-adobe-illustrator-cs3">Illustrator</a> and <a href="/virtualisation/sequencing-adobe-indesign-cs3">InDesign</a>) and some <a href="/virtualisation/addressing-licensing-issues-with-adobe-cs3-apps-on-softgrid">challenges related to the FLEXnet licensing</a> component that comes with each application. It’s only recently that we’ve been able to do some user acceptance testing and we’ve found that the applications have failed.</p>

<p>During initial testing I found that I could not get multiple CS3 application bubbles executing because the FLEXnet service in the second bubble would fail. Exactly why we’re unsure, but I had found that stopping the service post launch would allow multiple CS3 applications to run successfully. Unfortunately that assumption was incorrect.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2008/06/flexnet.png" border="0" alt="FlexNet" width="599" height="28" /></p>

<p>My mate <a href="http://www.dougandjodie.com/">Doug</a>, who’s now working with us, has taken up the challenge and come up with a solution. This involves installing the FLEXnet licensing service natively on the sequencer before sequencing and ensuring this service is deployed to your client machines.</p>

<p>Now the bad news is there is no easy way to do that. We have gotten around this because we have Adobe Acrobat 8 installed natively and thus the FLEXnet service is almost everywhere. So we’ve sequenced with Adobe Acrobat installed on the sequencing machine and our CS3 applications are working as expected.</p>

<p>You might be able to get yourself a copy of the FLEXnet service for installation, but you’ll need to chase <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a> or <a href="http://www.acresso.com/">Acresso</a> to obtain it.</p>
