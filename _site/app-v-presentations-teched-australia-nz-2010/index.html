<p><a href="http://www.msteched.com/2010/Australia/CLI307">When Things Go Wrong: How to Effectively and Efficiently Troubleshoot App-V Deployments</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an in-depth view of basic troubleshooting techniques from creating virtual packages of complex applications, diagnosing client deployment issues, and troubleshooting package publication and delivery to the client. There are a number of diagnostic and troubleshooting features in Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) and we show how to use them to roll out and leverage your App-V deployment. For example, the App-V sequencer will virtualize the majority of the applications thrown at it, but sometimes you will need to use some advanced features to complete creating a virtual package for a complex app. We show you how to use built-in log files and external tools such as Procmon to understand why a virtual package is not working as expected and how to make changes to enable it to work as expected…</p>
