            Dynamic Software Update Rings in Microsoft Intune

        </h3><p>Microsoft Intune provides management of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/windows-update-for-business-configure">Window 10 Update Rings</a> to enable <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview#servicing-channels">Windows as a Service</a>, via the Software Updates feature. This enrols a Windows PC into Windows Update for Business to manage feature and quality updates the device receives and how quickly it updates to a new release. As you scale the number of devices managed by Microsoft Intune, the need to manage the software update or <a href="https://blog.juriba.com/windows-10-deployment-rings">deployment rings</a> is key to adopting Windows 10 successfully. Being able to do so dynamically and empowering end-users by involving them in the process sounds like an idea that’s just crazy enough to work. This article details an approach to achieve dynamic software update rings.</p>

You can <a href="https://configmgrblog.com/2017/08/29/how-to-deploy-the-citrix-receiver-for-windows-10-via-microsoft-intune/">create a custom wrapper to deploy Receiver</a>, but this requires a packaging tool and some specific knowledge on how to package applications.</p>

An environment with an enterprise certificate authority can enable certificate autoenrollment to enable trusted certificates on the RDP listener, thus removing the prompt. To get OS X clients to accept the certificate takes a little extra configuration not required on Windows clients.</p>

            Updating an MCS-based XenDesktop Machine Catalog with PowerShell
          </a>
        </h3><p>I wrote previously about <a href="/xendesktop-mcs-machine-catalog-powershell/">automating the creation of an MCS-based machine catalog in XenDesktop with PowerShell</a>, so in this article I’ll cover updating that machine catalog via PowerShell.</p>

<p>Separate to this article would be the process of creating the updated image - that could be done manually (by updating the existing master image), or by <a href="/briforum-2014-hands-off-my-gold-image-the-slides/">automating a new master image deployment with MDT</a>, or any other method that you can think of.</p>

<p>Just as with creating the machine catalog, the PowerShell output from Studio when updating a catalog is a place to start - the code provided isn’t reusable without some effort to make it work.</p>

<h1 id="linking-the-code-to-the-ui">Linking the Code to the UI</h1>

<p>I’ll walk briefly through the wizards to show, in part, how the code relates to each step when updating a machine catalog via the Studio UI.</p>

<p>In this case, I’ve already created the machine catalog and updated my master image and created a snapshot. The hypervisor isn’t important because Citrix Studio abstracts this from the process when performing the update (I do need to be using the same infrastructure as the target catalog).</p>

<p>To find the snapshot to use, I’ve obtained the path to the master image and a specified snapshot via the <em>Get-ChildItem</em> command (on the path XDHyp:\HostingUnits&lt;Storage Resource&gt;). This is essentially a path/directory that I can parse - I’ve explicitly specified the master image and the snapshot to use. I need the path to the snapshot so that I can use that in the publish step for the image update.</p>

I can choose from a couple of rollout strategies for the image update - I can choose to update on next shutdown of the desktop, or update immediately (with a specified delay).

There’s plenty that the wizard does to hide the complexity of setting up a catalog from the administrator. If you attempt the same via PowerShell, what goes on under the hood is laid bare.

# The Code

Below is the full code listing with comments inline that should provide some detail on the process the code follows. At this point the code provides some error checking for the most important steps. There are still some additional steps and error checking that could be integrated:

  * The code will get a specified snapshot from the target VM. I've done this to ensure I'm using the correct version of the image
  * Publish the image update to the catalog
  * Monitor the update process until completion
  * Start the desktop reboot cycle

At this stage, I haven't added too much error checking, but an important step to add will be to check that the image update process was successful and rollback if it wasn't.

          <a class="post-link" href="/appv-publishing-xendesktop-powershell/">
            Adding App-V Publishing Information to a XenDesktop Site with PowerShell
          </a>
        </h3><p>Adding <a href="http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/xenapp-xendesktop-76/xad-app-v.html">Microsoft App-V publishing information to a XenDesktop or XenApp 7.x site</a> is very easy via the Citrix Studio UI, but what if you want to automate this process? Of course, you’ll need to reach for PowerShell.</p>

<p>What may not be widely known is that you can add additional App-V publishing configuration to a XenDesktop site beyond what you see in the UI. This allows you to set publishing information per delivery group. Useful for complex XenDesktop sites such as multi-tenant environments.</p>

<p>Creating the App-V publishing information with PowerShell is a multi step process. You’ll need to create the publishing information with <a href="http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-appv-admin-v1-xd75/new-ctxappvserver-xd75.html">New-CtxAppVServer</a> and then apply the configuration with <a href="http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokermachineconfiguration-xd75.html">New-BrokerMachineConfiguration</a>.</p>

<p>Applying this in practice however may ultimately require testing the App-V management and publishing servers and ensuring that the configuration does not already exist before adding it.</p>

<p>So to do that, I’ve written a function that will take the App-V Management and Publishing servers as parameters, ensure that they test OK and check that the configuration does not already exist before importing the configuration into the site.</p>

<p>This function is fairly basic and while it does do some error checking, it could probably go a little further to ensure the configuration is applied successfully.</p>

<pre class="lang:ps decode:true" title="Add App-V Publishing information to a XenDesktop site">Function Set-CtxAppvConfig {

        .SYNOPSIS

<p>Note - a very big thanks to David Wagner at Citrix (and team) for assisting with working out how to write the App-V publishing information that you see in the Studio UI. This is done by applying the description “Created with Studio” to the publishing configuration (presumably only the first configuration that you apply with that description).</p>

            View Memory Stats on a Hyper-V Server
          </a>
        </h3><p>I’ve got a very simple setup in <a href="/lab-server-to-run-esxi-hyper-v/">my home lab</a> with a couple of machine running either Hyper-V or ESXi. I typically don’t have monitoring solutions running and manage each host directly, rather than part of a cluster or with SCVMM or vCenter. For Hyper-V, I try to manage it remotely via PowerShell as much as I can and so it’s handy to be able to see memory utilisation on the remote host to understand how much capacity I’ve got before powering on a VM. I’ve written a PowerShell function to return various memory stats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total RAM available in the host - using <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=306853">Get-VMHost</a>.</li>
  <li>Total memory in use by running VMs - by returning the running VMs and finding the current amount of RAM assigned to each VM with <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=306845">Get-VM</a>. This works with dynamic memory.</li>
  <li>Available memory to run additional VMs - using <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=289625">Get-Counter</a> to gather the ‘\Memory\Available Bytes’ performance counter</li>
  <li>How much memory is used by the system - this is calculated by adding what’s in use by VMs, to the available memory and subtracting the results from the physical RAM in the host. This is a rough calculation, but an interesting metric to view.</li>
</ul>

<p>The function returns an array that includes each stat. Here’s an example of what the function returns. All values are in gigabytes and multiple hosts can be specified to gather details from.</p>

<pre class="striped:false nums:false nums-toggle:false wrap-toggle:false plain:false plain-toggle:false show-plain-default:true lang:ps highlight:0 decode:true ">PS C:\&gt; Get-HvMem -ComputerName hv1

<p>Like the last article, I’ve taken the PowerShell generated by Citrix Studio, banged my head against the wall a few times, and improved it to create the code presented in this article.</p>

<h1 id="linking-the-code-to-the-ui">Linking the Code to the UI</h1>

<p>To help explain the code, I’ll first run through the Create Delivery Group wizard and show how the code relates to options in the wizard and the Delivery Group properties.</p>

[_New-BrokerEntitlementPolicyRule_](#http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokerentitlementpolicyrule-xd75.html) is used to assign user or group accounts to the Delivery Group.

[_Add-BrokerMachineConfiguration_](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/add-brokermachineconfiguration-xd75.html) adds StoreFront and UPM configurations to a Delivery Group. The function just adds a machine configuration - the configuration is setup separately. To avoid selecting a StoreFront server for the Delivery Group, don't use this function.

When calling [_New-BrokerDesktopGroup_](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokerdesktopgroup-xd75.html), the Delivery Group name, display or published name and description is specified.

The wizard does not expose all settings for the Delivery Group, so additional settings require opening the properties of the new group. These can be set during creation of the group when using PowerShell.

The same call to _[New-BrokerDesktopGroup](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokerdesktopgroup-xd75.html)_ is used to specify user settings including colour depth and time zone preferences.

Creating the Delivery Group is relatively straight-forward; however there are some additional steps, such as creating a StoreFront server and working out how to manage peak and off peak times, that require a bit more investigation.

# The Code

Below is the full code listing with comments inline that should provide some detail on the process the code follows. At this point the code provides some error checking for the most important steps. There are still some additional steps and error checking that could be integrated into the code.

          <a class="post-link" href="/xendesktop-mcs-machine-catalog-powershell/">
            Creating an MCS-based XenDesktop Machine Catalog with PowerShell
          </a>
        </h3><p>Driving XenDesktop with PowerShell is a challenge to say the least. While <a href="http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/xenapp-xendesktop-75/cds-sdk-cmdlet-help.html">documentation for the XenDesktop PowerShell modules</a> is OK and Citrix Studio outputs PowerShell code after you’ve completed a task in the console, there’s still plenty of work to get that code into something usable.</p>

<p>As part of an ongoing series of articles themed around automating virtual desktop deployment, I’ve written some PowerShell code to automate the creation of an non-persistent, MCS-based Machine Catalog based on <a href="/briforum-2014-hands-off-my-gold-image-the-slides/">a specific Windows image, that we’ve already automated</a> with a solution such as MDT.</p>

<p>Don’t expect to copy and paste the PowerShell output in Citrix Studio and have a complete script. The code is missing a number of lines that link tasks together. I found this article on the Citrix Blogs quite useful - <a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2012/03/06/using-powershell-to-create-a-catalog-of-machine-creations-services-machines/">Using PowerShell to Create a Catalog of Machine Creations Services Machines</a>; however I’ve taken my script a few steps further.</p>

<h1 id="linking-the-code-to-the-ui">Linking the Code to the UI</h1>

<p>While the Create Machine Catalog wizard doesn’t expose everything that goes on behind the scenes when a machine catalog is created, I think it’s still worth showing how specific functions relate to choices that the administrator makes in the wizard.</p>

<p>The screenshots below show just a snippet of the functions required to automate the catalog creation using PowerShell. These walkthrough the same environment that the full code listing at the end of this article is creating. See the image captions for example code that applies to each step.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokercatalog-xd75.html"><em>New-BrokerCataog</em></a> is used to create the machine catalog and set a number of properties. You’ll see <a href="http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokercatalog-xd75.html"><em>New-BrokerCatalog</em></a> across a number of these screen shots. First up is setting the broker type - in this instance, I’m deploying a Windows 8 image, so need to choose ‘Windows Desktop OS’:</p>

<figure id="attachment_3654" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3654" style="width: 806px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="wp-image-3654 size-full" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogType.png" alt="Selecting the Machine Catalog type - New-BrokerCatalog SessionSupport SingleSession" width="806" height="585" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogType.png 806w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogType-150x108.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogType-300x217.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogType-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" />](/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogType.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-3654" class="wp-caption-text">Selecting the Machine Catalog type - New-BrokerCatalog -SessionSupport SingleSession*&lt;/figure&gt;

Because were using MCS, I'm going to specify that I'm using virtual machines and choose the storage on which to deploy those VMs and use the _ProvisioningType_ parameter on [_New-BrokerCatalog_](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokercatalog-xd75.html) to specify MCS. This is done in PowerShell via a number of commands - see around line 45 where we specify the hypervisor management and storage resource to use.

<figure id="attachment_3657" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3657" style="width: 806px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-full wp-image-3657" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineManagement.png" alt="Selecting the provisioning type - New-BrokerCatalog -ProvisioningType $provType" width="806" height="585" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineManagement.png 806w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineManagement-150x108.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineManagement-300x217.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineManagement-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" />](/media/2014/08/MachineManagement.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-3657" class="wp-caption-text">Selecting the provisioning type - New-BrokerCatalog -ProvisioningType MCS*&lt;/figure&gt;

Also on the [_New-BrokerCatalog_](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokercatalog-xd75.html), we can specify that this is a set of randomly assigned desktops.

<figure id="attachment_3658" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3658" style="width: 806px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-full wp-image-3658" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/DesktopExperience.png" alt="Selecting Random or Static desktops - New-BrokerCatalog -AllocationType Random" width="806" height="585" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/DesktopExperience.png 806w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/DesktopExperience-150x108.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/DesktopExperience-300x217.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/DesktopExperience-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" />](/media/2014/08/DesktopExperience.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-3658" class="wp-caption-text">Selecting Random or Static desktops - New-BrokerCatalog -AllocationType Random*&lt;/figure&gt;

To find the image to use, I've obtained the path to the master image and its snapshot via the _Get-ChildItem_ command (on the path XDHyp:\HostingUnits\<Storage Resource="">) and passed that to [_New-ProvScheme_](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-machinecreation-admin-v2-xd75/new-provscheme-xd75.html).

<figure id="attachment_3659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3659" style="width: 806px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-full wp-image-3659" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MasterImageAndSnapshot.png" alt="Selecting the master image and snapshot to use - New-ProvScheme -ProvisioningSchemeName &quot;Windows 8&quot; -HostingUnitName &quot;HV1-LocalStorage -MasterImageVM &quot;XDHyp:\HostingUnits\HV1-LocalStorage\WIN81.vm\MasterImage.snapshot&quot;" width="806" height="585" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MasterImageAndSnapshot.png 806w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MasterImageAndSnapshot-150x108.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MasterImageAndSnapshot-300x217.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MasterImageAndSnapshot-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" />](/media/2014/08/MasterImageAndSnapshot.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-3659" class="wp-caption-text">Selecting the master image and snapshot to use - New-ProvScheme -ProvisioningSchemeName "Windows 8" -HostingUnitName "HV1-LocalStorage" -MasterImageVM "XDHyp:\HostingUnits\HV1-LocalStorage\WIN81.vm\MasterImage.snapshot"*&lt;/figure&gt;

Also with _[New-ProvScheme](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-machinecreation-admin-v2-xd75/new-provscheme-xd75.html)_ we can set the number of virtual CPUs and the amount of RAM to assign to each virtual desktop. To specify the number of desktops to create, we're actually first specifying the number of AD machine accounts to create via _[New-AcctADAccount](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-adidentity-admin-v2-xd75/new-acctadaccount-xd75.html)_ and then creating the same number of desktops to assign to those accounts.

<figure id="attachment_3660" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3660" style="width: 806px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-full wp-image-3660" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/VirtualMachineConfiguration.png" alt="Selecting the virtual machine configurations - New-ProvScheme -VMCpuCount 2 -VMMemoryMB 2048" width="806" height="585" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/VirtualMachineConfiguration.png 806w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/VirtualMachineConfiguration-150x108.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/VirtualMachineConfiguration-300x217.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/VirtualMachineConfiguration-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" />](/media/2014/08/VirtualMachineConfiguration.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-3660" class="wp-caption-text">Selecting the virtual machine configurations - New-ProvScheme -VMCpuCount 2 -VMMemoryMB 2048*&lt;/figure&gt;

[_New-AcctIdentityPool_](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-adidentity-admin-v2-xd75/new-acctidentitypool-xd75.html) is used to create an identity pool that stores the machine accounts by specifying the naming convention and where the accounts will be stored.

<figure id="attachment_3661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3661" style="width: 806px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-full wp-image-3661" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/ActiveDirectoryAndMachineAccountName.png" alt="Setting machine account names and location - New-AcctIdentityPool -Domain 'home.stealthpuppy.com' -NamingScheme 'W8-MCS-###'-NamingSchemeType Numeric -OU 'OU=MCS Pooled,OU=Workstations,DC=home,DC=stealthpuppy,DC=com'" width="806" height="585" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/ActiveDirectoryAndMachineAccountName.png 806w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/ActiveDirectoryAndMachineAccountName-150x108.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/ActiveDirectoryAndMachineAccountName-300x217.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/ActiveDirectoryAndMachineAccountName-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" />](/media/2014/08/ActiveDirectoryAndMachineAccountName.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-3661" class="wp-caption-text">Setting machine account names and location - New-AcctIdentityPool -Domain 'home.stealthpuppy.com' -NamingScheme 'W8-MCS-###'-NamingSchemeType Numeric -OU 'OU=MCS Pooled,OU=Workstations,DC=home,DC=stealthpuppy,DC=com'*&lt;/figure&gt;

Again we can see where _[New-BrokerCataog](http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/citrix-broker-admin-v2-xd75/new-brokercatalog-xd75.html)_ is used to specify the catalog name and description.

<figure id="attachment_3662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3662" style="width: 806px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-full wp-image-3662" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogNameAndDescription.png" alt="Setting the machine catalog name and description - New-BrokerCatalog  -Name &quot;Windows 8 x86&quot; -Description &quot;Windows 8.1 x86 SP1 with Office 2013&quot;" width="806" height="585" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogNameAndDescription.png 806w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogNameAndDescription-150x108.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogNameAndDescription-300x217.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogNameAndDescription-624x452.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" />](/media/2014/08/MachineCatalogNameAndDescription.png)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-3662" class="wp-caption-text">Setting the machine catalog name and description - New-BrokerCatalog -Name "Windows 8 x86" -Description "Windows 8.1 x86 SP1 with Office 2013"*&lt;/figure&gt;

There's plenty that the wizard does to hide the complexity of setting up a catalog from the administrator. If you attempt the same via PowerShell, what goes on under the hood is laid bare.

# The Code

Below is the full code listing with comments inline that should provide some detail on the process the code follows. At this point the code provides some error checking for the most important steps. There are still some additional steps and error checking that could be integrated:

  * This code should find the last snapshot of the target master image; it would be simple enough to specify a particular snapshot if required
  * Checking whether provisioning schemes are already available or exist before attempting to create a new provisioning scheme
  * Additional checking that some tasks have completed successfully before continuing

            Retrieving a VM&#39;s UUID from Hyper-V
          </a>
        </h3><p>I’ve previously posted about retrieving the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a> from <a href="/retrieving-a-vms-uuid-from-vsphere/">a virtual machine hosted on vSphere</a>. UUIDs are useful if you want to uniquely identify a target machine for OS deployment task sequences and the like (e.g. MDT). Here’s how to obtain the UUID from a virtual machine hosted on Hyper-V.</p>

<p>Just like with vSphere, the UUID isn’t a property of the virtual machine that can be queried directly. We need to go via WMI to query the target virtual machine. Note that in this function, I’m using <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2012/05/30/the-v2-wmi-namespace-in-hyper-v-on-windows-8.aspx">version 2 of the Root\Virtualization WMI namespace</a> (root\virtualization\v2. This means the function as written, will <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh850319(v=vs.85)">only work on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012</a> (and above). If you want to use this function on earlier versions of Hyper-V, remove the “\v2” from the namespace.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s how to retrieve the UUIDs from a set of VMs on a target Hyper-V host named <em>hv1</em>:</p>

<div class="language-powershell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C:\&gt; Get-HypervVMUUID -ComputerName hv1 -VM win71, file3, pvs1

            Sequential Starting of a List of VMs
          </a>
        </h3><p>In my lab environment, I often want to start a list of virtual machines, but without taxing the system in the process by starting them all at the same time.  I could do that manually, but that’s no fun.</p>

<p>Here’s a short function I wrote to sequentially start a list of virtual machines - the script will start a VM and wait for that VM to boot before starting the next VM. You can optionally also wait additional time before starting the next VM to give the first one some time to finish starting it’s services etc.</p>

<p>This version currently supports Hyper-V only. The script does not currently return anything, but has a number of parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ComputerName - the name of the Hyper-V host. Specify “.” for the local machine (without quotes)</li>
  <li>VM - specify a comma separated list of VMs</li>
  <li>Wait - the number of seconds to wait between starting a VM after the previous VM. Specify the number of VMs as a number (integer) only. This will default to 180 seconds</li>
  <li>ShowProgress - Specify whether to show progress while starting the VMs. This is cosmetic only, but does give some indication as to how far through the boot process the script is.</li>
  <li>Other standard parameters such as Verbose are supported.</li>
</ul>

        .PARAMETER ComputerName
            Specifies the Hyper-V host to start the VM on.
 
        .PARAMETER VM
            Specifies a list of VMs to start.
 
        .PARAMETER Wait
            Specifies a number of seconds to wait after the previous VM has booted successfully. Defaults to 180 seconds.

        .PARAMETER ShowProgress
            Specified whether to show progress as VMs are started.

            A Better Way to Customize the Windows Default Profile
          </a>
        </h3><h1 id="multiple-methods">Multiple Methods</h1>

<p>The Deployment Guys have a great article from 2009 that I recommend reading for a overview of customisation methods: <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/deploymentguys/archive/2009/10/29/configuring-default-user-settings-full-update-for-windows-7-and-windows-server-2008-r2.aspx">Configuring Default User Settings – Full Update for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2</a>. This article is still applicable today and the process hasn’t changed that much between Windows versions. Here are most of the ways that you could edit the default user profile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy a configured profile over the default profile - this is the most common way of changing the default user experience but this approach is unsupported by Microsoft and therefore I recommend against using it.</li>
  <li>Using Sysprep and the CopyProfile value - this approach requires creating a reference image and using Sysprep to generalise the image. Many enterprise desktop deployments will use reference images so this isn’t too hard; however Microsoft has not documented every setting that is copied to the default user profile, so it’s a bit of pot luck.</li>
  <li>Place a default profile in NETLOGON - a default profile copied to the NETLOGON share of a domain controller (and replicated) will be copied down to the local machine at first logon. The downside of this approach is that there can be only one default profile and it will be copied to all machines, regardless as to whether the profile should apply to that machine or not.</li>
  <li>Commands or scripts run from the RunOnce Registry key to edit the user profile.</li>
  <li>Logon scripts to edit the user profile.</li>
  <li>Group Policy Preferences - GPP has become more prevalent in the past few years, so should now be available across the board.</li>
  <li>Editing the default profile directly, typically during an automated deployment, but you could run the same script on any existing PC.</li>
</ul>

<p>So there are multiple methods (of driving yourself to madness), I’d recommend experimenting with each approach and you’ll most likely implement a combination of approaches to best suit your environment.</p>

<h1 id="group-policy-as-a-last-resort">Group Policy As A Last Resort</h1>

<p>Group Policy is great, until it isn’t. Group Policy is pervasive and every Windows admin is familiar with it, but there a two things to consider when using it to manage the default user experience:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Group Policy is is a policy - that is, if you’re using policies to manage default user settings, the user cannot then change to their own preference.</li>
  <li>Group Policy Preferences must be processed to determine whether they have been applied. Whilst GPPs can implement a preference rather than a policy, Windows must determine whether the preference has been applied by reading a flag. Whilst checking those flags isn’t a big problem, implementing GPPs should be considered in the context of whatever else is running at logon, how many preferences are implemented plus what happens to the environment over time (how many additional policies, applications, scripts etc. will be added to the environment over the life of that desktop).</li>
</ol>

<p>I have seen many organisations over-relying on Group Policy and missing the most important component user environment management - change control and ownership. Group Policy becomes a black hole, complete with settings that no one can remember why they were implemented and settings that are no longer relevant. Group Policy Preferences are great for replacing logon scripts, but use Group Policy and GPP sparingly so as not to adversely affect the user experience.</p>

<h1 id="a-better-way---edit-the-default-profile-directly">A Better Way - Edit the Default Profile Directly</h1>

<p>My preferred method for modifying the default user experience is to edit the default user profile directly using a script that is run during Windows deployment. This type of script can also be run on existing machines or used in combination with CopyProfile. A benefit of this approach is that you can modify the default profile with or without a reference image.</p>

<h2 id="editing-the-default-profile">Editing the Default Profile</h2>

<p>To edit the default profile, we’ll use the command line tool REG to mount and make changes to the default user registry hive. Additionally we can make folder and file changes to the default profile and a couple of other command line tools to perform tasks such as pin and unpin shortcuts or change the Windows 7 Libraries. As far as this article is concerned, the default profile is in its default location, usually C:\Users\Default. In a script, you could refer to this location as %SystemDrive%\Users\Default.</p>

<h3 id="finding-settings">Finding Settings</h3>

<p>To find the profile locations to modify there’s a couple of methods that I rely on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google (or your favourite search engine)</li>
  <li>Process Monitor and Process Explorer</li>
</ul>

<p>In most cases, someone (or even Microsoft) will have documented a registry value or profile location that is used to store a setting. More obscure or new settings will require detecting the location with Process Monitor. For example, to determine where a setting is stored in the Registry, create a filter in Process Monitor using the process name or process ID, additionally filtering on the operation such as RegSetValue, as shown below:</p>

<p><a href="/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-Filter.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3525 alignnone" alt="Configuring Process Monitor filter " src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-Filter.png" width="519" height="310" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-Filter.png 519w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-Filter-150x89.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-Filter-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></a></p>

<p>A trace with Process Monitor when making a preference change should result in something like this:</p>

<p><a href="/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3532" alt="Process Monitor results" src="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer.png" width="888" height="464" srcset="https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer.png 888w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-150x78.png 150w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-300x156.png 300w, https://stealthpuppy.com/media/2013/12/ProcessMonitor-Explorer-624x326.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/regshot/">Regshot</a> is also useful for comparing a before and after change to the profile for determining registry value locations.</p>

<p>Additionally Process Explorer can be useful for tracking down a process that might be responsible for writing a setting by viewing the command line used to launch the process. Finding settings can sometimes be a time consuming process, but once found and documented, you’ve got a detailed understanding of the default profile.</p>

<h3 id="editing-the-registry">Editing the Registry</h3>

<p>To make direct registry edits to the default user profile, the REG command line utility is used to load the default profile registry hive, change a registry value and then unload the hive, saving it back to the default profile. The following lines show a rough example of how this is done:</p>

<pre class="lang:batch decode:true">REG LOAD HKU\DefaultUser %SystemDrive%\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT
REG ADD HKU\DefaultUser\Software\KeyName /v ValueName /d Data /t REG_SZ /f
REG UNLOAD HKU\DefaultUser</pre>

<p>Note that this will need to be run with administrative privileges and in an elevated context, so that you have write access to the default profile.</p>

<h2 id="pinning-and-unpinning-shortcuts">Pinning and Unpinning Shortcuts</h2>

<p>A common requirement is to modify the the pinned shortcuts on the Taskbar or Start menu. This can be automated using a script, which needs to run a first logon (either as the user, or in the profile copied over the default profile via Sysprep/CopyProfile). Unfortunately I can’t find the original source for this script; however it works quite well and allows you to pin shortcuts to and unpin shortcuts from the Taskbar and Start menu via a command line. The script is available here:</p>

<p class="important">
  [download id="62&#8243; format="1&#8243;]
</p>

<p>Note that Windows 8 and above, do not expose a programatic method to pin and unpin shortcuts to the Start screen. If you’re looking to customise the Start screen, refer to this existing article: <a href="https://stealthpuppy.com/customizing-the-windows-8-1-start-screen-dont-follow-microsofts-guidance/">https://stealthpuppy.com/customizing-the-windows-8-1-start-screen-dont-follow-microsofts-guidance/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="modifying-the-windows-libraries">Modifying the Windows Libraries</h2>

<p>By default, the Libraries introduced in Windows 7, include the public folder locations. Removing these or adding locations requires editing the Libraries; however they’re stored in XML files and are created at first logon. To modify the libraries, you can use a command line tool ShLib.exe. Like pinning and unpinning shortcuts, this tool also needs to be run at first logon (and won’t work via CopyProfile). This article, <a href="http://www.grimadmin.com/article.php/creating-modifying-windows-7-libraries">Administratively Create and Modify Windows 7 Libraries</a>, covers the use of ShLib.exe quite well.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-a-script-to-modify-the-default-profile">Implementing a Script to Modify the Default Profile</h2>

<p>Once you’ve created your script to make changes to the default registry, modify the default profile folder locations, pin and unpin shortcuts and make changes to the Libraries, you’ll need to implement the changes on the target PCs via script. Using an automation solution such as the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (or an ESD like System Center Configuration Manager) the script can be run during a deployment task sequence. In the case of MDT, the script will be run after Windows unattended setup has completed in the local Administrator context. This way the script will have full elevation and write access to the default profile. An ESD solution will typically run the script via the local SYSTEM account. If you need to make changes to existing PCs, you’ll need a method to do so, such as an advertisement in Configuration Manager. If you take this approach, you can combine a script that makes direct changes to the default profile with the CopyProfile approach. That allows you to modify the profile for deployments from an unmodified OS as well as a custom image, keeping consistency across deployment types.</p>

<h1 id="example-scripts">Example Scripts</h1>

<p>Included here, along with some notation, are some example scripts for modifying the Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 default profiles. These example scripts include creation of a script at runtime that will run during first logon of any new profile. This is implemented as a batch file to keep things as simple as possible. Users will see a Command Prompt window as the script runs (but only once). The command lines includes in the script could be implemented with a UEM solution such as AppSense Environment Manager or even Group Policy to improve the user experience.</p>

<h2 id="windows-7">Windows 7</h2>

<p>Here’s a sample script that will modify the default profile on a Windows 7 PC (x86 and x64). At a high level, the script will perform the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Load and modifies the registry of the default profile</li>
  <li>Copies ExecuteVerbAction.VBS and ShLib.exe to folder under %ProgramFiles%</li>
  <li>Creates a batch script that will run on first logon to edit the Libraries and pin/unpin shortcuts. Once the script runs for the user, it will delete itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use this in a production environment, please test and confirm each setting to ensure you understand what the script will implement.</p>

<h1 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h1>

<p>There are numerous ways to edit the default profile, some more complicated and involved than others. It’s my view that the best way to modify the default profile is targeting the required settings, which does mean more work. However, this approach results in a better understanding of the user environment and with any luck a better user experience.</p>

<p>Each new major release of Windows results in less modifications, so your job will be easier. There are a few scripts and tools you’ll need to have in place and I’m confident the approach outlined here will result in happy users (or at least users who aren’t complaining).</p>

<p>In the next article on the same subject, I’ll cover customising the default profile for Remote Desktop Services Session Hosts.</p>

<p>I recently posted a script for removing unnecessary files and pruning files based on their age, which can be used at logoff to keep profile sizes manageable - <a href="/user-virtualization/profile-clean-up-script/">Reducing Profile Size with a Profile Clean Up Script</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://andrewmorgan.ie/about-2/">Andrew Morgan</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/andyjmorgan">@andyjmorgan</a>) has kindly translated my very basic VBscript to PowerShell. This can be used as a standalone script or the function (<em>remove-itembyage</em>) could be integrated into your own scripts and has the added benefit of in-built help and the ability to run silently.</p>

<p>Just like the original script, this could be executed at logoff, before the profile is saved back to the network, to perform two actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Delete all files of a specific file type in a specified folder, including sub-folders</li>
  <li>Delete all files older than X days in a specified folder, including sub-folders</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, you could use the script to delete all .log or temporary files below %APPDATA% that aren’t required to be roamed, or delete all Cookies older than 90 days to keep the Cookies folder to a manageable size.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the script listing below has the -whatif parameter applied when calling the function, so no deletes will occur unless the parameter is removed.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-powershell" data-start-line="1" data-visibility="visible" data-highlight="" data-caption="">function remove-itembyage {
    &lt;#
        .SYNOPSIS
        remove items from folders recursively.

        .DESCRIPTION
        this function removes items older than a specified age from the target folder

        .PARAMETER Days
        Specifies the ammount of days since the file was last written to you wish to filter on.

        .PARAMETER Path
        Specifies the path to the folder you wish to search recursively.

        .PARAMETER Silent
        Instructs the function not to return any output.

        .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\&gt; remove-itembyage -days 0 -path $recent

        This command searches the $recent directory, for any files, then deletes them.

        .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\&gt; remove-itembyage -days 5 -path $recent

        This command searches the $recent directory, for files older than 5 days, then deletes them.

        .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\&gt; remove-itembyage -days 10 -path $appdata -typefilter "txt,log"

        This command searches the $cookies directory, for files older than 10 days and end with txt or log extensions, then deletes them.

        .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\&gt; remove-itembyage -days 10 -path $cookies -typefilter "txt,log" -silent

        This command searches the $cookies directory, for files older than 10 days and end with txt or log extensions, then deletes them without a report.

<p>Windows profiles become larger over time - it’s an inescapable fact. This means that if you are using roaming profiles, logons (and logoff) will be longer and longer. It’s not just individual file sizes, but also the number of files stored in a profile that will make the synchronisation process slower.</p>

<p>One approach to reducing profile sizes is to <a href="/virtualisation/reduce-logon-times-by-excluding-the-bloat/">exclude certain folders</a>. A better solution is to ditch roaming profiles and use <a href="http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/rubenspruijt/archive/2011/11/01/user-environment-management-smackdown-head-to-head-analysis-of-appsense-citrix-immidio-liquidware-labs-microsoft-quest-res-scense-tricerat-unidesk-and-vuem.aspx">a third-party solution to manage roaming of the user environment</a>.</p>

<p>However, there will still be folders that need to be roamed to maintain the experience that users expect when moving between devices (i.e. consistency). For those folders we can implement some maintenance to keep them at a manageable size - that is remove files that are not needed in a roaming profile (e.g. log files) or delete files older than a specific number of days.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning</span>: <em>there’s a reason that Windows doesn’t do this maintenance itself - only each application vendor will have an understanding of whether specific files are required or can be discarded (hence the roaming and local portions of AppData). However, as any experienced Windows admin knows - many vendors either don’t test for or don’t care about roaming scenarios, therefore I strongly recommend testing this approach before production deployment.</em></p>

<p>As a part of <a href="/general/appsense-environment-manager-8-x-baseline-configuration/">an upcoming version of this configuration</a>, I’ve created a script that will execute at logoff, before the profile is saved back to the network, that will perform two actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Delete all files of a specific file type in a specified folder, including sub-folders</li>
  <li>Delete all files older than X days in a specified folder, including sub-folders</li>
</ol>

<p>So for example, you could use the script to delete all .log files below %APPDATA% or delete all Cookies older than 90 days.</p>

<p>The script is extremely simple on purpose and I recommend testing thoroughly before implementing - use at your own risk; however feedback is welcome.</p>

It’s a good read and there’s a fair number of little gems in there. I’ve been meaning to post some links to his site for some time, but I’ve just been slack and haven’t gotten around to it. Who is Gordon? Here’s what he says:</p>

I think the implementation of PowerShell as the basis for all Exchange management is a good thing €“ there’s nothing like being able to paste the exact command line into your change log. However there’s been a couple of issue that I’ve got with Exchange 2007:</p>

I’ve put together a list of those files and whether you need to elevate to run them. If you do need to elevate you will have to do so by running them from an elevated command prompt. Note that you can run these without having to add the .MSC extension. The exception to this is SERVICES.MSC.</p>

I’m unsure if this hotfix is generally available, but if you are experiencing the issue give the good looking guys at Citrix Support a call to obtain a copy of the fix, or wait until a general hotfix is available from the Citrix support web site.</p>

Now with ISA Server 2006, we have a more elegant solution that allows us to integrate RSA SecurID directly into the forms authentication method. Assuming ISA Server is a domain member, here’s how to do it.</p>

        </h3><p>Customising Logon points in Advanced Access Control is a fairly easy process. Customisation allows you to add a corporate look and feel to the user interface. However, removing and redeploying the Logon Point will remove all customisations - the Logon Point is just a bunch of HTML and graphic files. Here’s how to customise the source files so that redeployed and new Logon Points will already have your customisations.</p>

        </h3><p>If you run CITRIX_ADMIN_MONITOR.EXE and after you enter the username and password the Access Gateway does not display, this could be related to proxy settings in Internet Explorer. Even adding the address of the Access Gateway to the proxy bypass list does not solve the issue. Disable proxy settings in Internet Explorer and the Access Gateway desktop displays immediately. In our case we have ISA Server 2004 as our firewall. ISA Server does not allow protocols other than HTTP to be tunnelled over SSL by default and if you check the log files you will see the connection being denied. So the solution here is to either, disable proxy settings when using CITRIX_ADMIN_MONITOR or enable port 9001 to be <a href="http://www.isaserver.org/articles/2004tunnelportrange.html">tunnelled over SSL</a>.</p>

        </h3><p>I’ve been checking out a recent build of Windows Vista today and took the chance to look at connecting to a remote Windows Vista machine from Windows Vista over RDP. The result was impressive to say the least. The remote session has full support for Aero Glass including all the minimise/maximise effects as well as Flip 3D. Now this would require that the Aero Glass is drawn on the screen locally rather than sent directly via RDP, which is what WPF Remoting is all about. Brian Madden has more on this <a href="http://www.brianmadden.com/content/content.asp?id=617">here</a> and <a href="http://www.brianmadden.com/content/content.asp?id=500">here</a>. Once this is teamed with seamless window support in Windows Longhorn Server the line between a local and remote application will be further blurred - users should almost never notice the difference. This is exciting stuff, as I am really into the user experience. In the Terminal Server world we are always battling what users perceive to be performance related issues. Once we can say good-bye to the current screen scraping type technologies in RDP and ICA I think users will be much happier. Of course we just need to get the applications to use WPF. Developers are you listening?</p>

        </h3><p>Always an interesting discussion around the traps is that of how much memory to install in Terminal Servers. Due to the nature of Terminal Server and limitations of the 32bit architecture, kernel address space will be exhausted before a Terminal Server will run out of RAM (depending on the number of users, of course). Brian Madden has <a href="http://www.brianmadden.com/content/content.asp?ID=69">an excellent article</a> discussing this limitation.</p>

Specifically Windows Servers running ISA Server 2004 or VMware Server (or Virtual Server). The argument for installing anti-virus software on these servers is to ensure they are protected against viruses and worms. I’ve been arguing against installing anti-virus software to ensure maximum performance. The reasons I have argued against are the following:</p>

        </h3><p>Backup the system state on your domain controllers. “Like duh!” you say, well that’s what I said too. I spent Friday a client’s site where a domain controller had gone down and they were experiencing issues with logons and Exchange. The client has/has four domain controllers, one at each of their four sites and all were marked as Global Catalog(ue)s. However once this single DC went down, due to hardware failure, AD essentially went bye-bye. Backups were no good and all the usual diagnostic tools would only show the downed DC as the lone GC. We could not seize the Schema Master and after spending about 6 hours on the phone with PSS, the decision was made to start again with a new domain, DC and Exchange server. Lots of fun that could have been avoided with products like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mom/default.mspx">Microsoft Operations Manager</a> or <a href="http://www.netiq.com/products/am/default.asp">NetIQ AppManager</a>. I still don’t understand why these types of products are generally a hard sell.</p>

A side effect of this was, however, that the application would take around 60 seconds to launch. Turns out the issue pops up on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and has to do with certificate autoenrollment. Essentially a 60 second delay is implemented to speed things up… Hmm, let ponder that for a second, accept it and move on. To relieve my application launch delay issue, I created the following registry key, the planets aligned, and all worked well.</p>
