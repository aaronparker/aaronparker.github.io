Aaron Parker, responsible for methodology, pre-sales and technical designs of leading class, enterprise solutions.

I've been in the IT industry for over 20 years and bring a wide range of experience in enterprise level End-user computing solutions, including Server-based computing, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, Mobility and PC deployments.

I have experience with primarily Microsoft, Citrix and VMware-based solutions and implemented these technologies across government, private sector & not-for-profit organizations. My interests lie in continuous improvements to IT to better enable business, by and taking advantage of existing solutions and new technologies and process.

I have spent the majority of my career in the channel working for system integrators in Australia and the UK and have extensive experience in the finance and transport sectors. Prior to working at Insentra, I was the pre-sales lead for the APAC region for Atlantis Computing.

## About stealthpuppy.com

This site (generally) focuses on end-user computing and enterprise mobility and is a way for me to not only write about interesting topics, but a way to give back the IT community. If I've been able to help you in your work in any way, that provides me with much satisfaction.

## Awards

I've been speaking events such as at Citrix Synergy, BriForum & E2EVC conferences in the US and Europe since 2011, writing here since 2006 and contributing to the community in a number of other areas and am very happy and fortunate to have been awarded the following community recognitions:
