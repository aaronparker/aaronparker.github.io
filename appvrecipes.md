Here&#8217;s a list of App-V recipes, tips and other resources available from Microsoft and the App-V community to assist with sequencing applications:

# Where to find information on sequencing

These guides should be followed when sequencing an application and will assist in creating a successful App-V package:

  * [Microsoft App-V 5.0 Sequencing Guide](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/7/8/F784A197-73BE-48FF-83DA-4102C05A6D44/App-V%205.0%20Sequencing%20Guide.docx)
  * [Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6 SP1 Sequencing Guide](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/7/8/F784A197-73BE-48FF-83DA-4102C05A6D44/App-V/App-V%204.6%20Service%20Pack%201%20Sequencing%20Guide.docx)
  * [Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.6 Sequencing Guide](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/7/8/F784A197-73BE-48FF-83DA-4102C05A6D44/App-46_Sequencing_Guide_Final.docx)
  * [Best practices to use for sequencing in Microsoft SoftGrid](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932137/en-us)

These locations host some excellent information for sequencing applications:

  * [Application Virtualization (App-V)](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/mdopappv/threads) forum on the TechNet Forums
  * [Sequencing](http://www.appvirtguru.com/viewforum.php?f=9&sid=f90286f14b4a830b4b7b4855d4f476c6) on AppVirtGuru.com
  * [ITNinja.com](http://www.itninja.com/software/browse) has details about silent installs which also includes instructions for virtualizing many packages

# Community Driven App-V Recipes and Tips Feed

<span style="color: #ff0000;">[Update &#8211; Feb 2016]</span> I&#8217;ve now closed my Delicious account since Delicious started showing unsolicited ads in the App-V recipe feeds. The entire list of tips and recipes is available here in a single static page: [App-V Recipes and Tips](http://stealthpuppy.com/files/delicious.html)

<del>I maintain a list of completed recipes plus various resources and recommendations for virtualizing applications with App-V, which you can view here &#8211; App-V Recipe bookmarks. Subscribe to this feed to keep up to date with new resources:</del>
